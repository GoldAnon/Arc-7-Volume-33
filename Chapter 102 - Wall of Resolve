*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Todd Fang did not consider himself to be particularly cautious or meticulous.

The result of trying to thoroughly investigate “as a matter of course” is closing every conceivable loophole, checking that all possible avenues are covered to the fullest extent possible, keeping assumptions as pessimistic as possible to reduce missteps.

Even if all of that is executed, if the opponent has prepared a strategy, action, or backdoor move that hadn’t been considered, you will be stunned, unable to do anything about it.

He was aware that this was the extent to which he had to come to terms with his natural abilities and reality.

Fortunately, I have never encountered such beings, or if I have, I have been able to avoid conclusive opposition, and I have survived to this day.

However――,

Todd: [――I've been unlucky as of late anyway.]

Looking back over the past month or two, a rather short period of time, Todd lamented to himself.

The bad luck began when he was incorporated into a group of troops deployed from the Imperial Capital to the east. Recalling that it was what had separated him from his fiancée, Katya, it was the worst event he’d experienced.

A man and a woman were swept down the river near their encampment――aside from the woman, the man was the catalyst for all of the bad luck that had befallen Todd to date.

As previously mentioned, Todd doesn't think of himself as special, but the man is out of his element. ――He was ordinary, yet extraordinary.

Few words were exchanged, and the time spent in contact was short, but the person in question was completely unaware of this.

Before and since then, Todd has seen a number of so-called outstanding individuals.

While everyone was aware of the fact that their own existence was outside the framework of the ordinary and that they had no choice but to walk their own unique path, this man was the exception to the rule.

It was bad enough. So, after that, if the opportunity arose, he just wanted to kill them at any cost.

However, once it became clear that this goal was unobtainable, Todd immediately abandoned his policy of extermination and chose to stay away from the pests. It was best not to get involved.

It was likewise necessary to sacrifice Jamal, his umbrella that protected him from the rain, in order to save Arakiya, who was being held captive. He thought that if he could win the favor of Arakiya, who had more power and authority, he would be able to escape from his unwanted position. ――But his plans were sidetracked.

In order to avenge Jamal's undesired death, he ended up being thrown into the middle of a major incident involving a rebellion against the emperor that was raging throughout the empire, leaving Katya in the imperial capital while making appropriate use of Arakiya, an empty-headed and completely unselfish person.

Absolutely nothing, truly nothing, is going right.

It seemed that the beginning of all this discontent was brought on by that pest. So he was hoping that at least these speculations would work out――.

Todd: [――My bad, my bad, and here I was going to get them all at once.]

Sneaking deep into enemy territory and launching a preemptive surprise attack.

Todd grumbled to himself as he looked at the remaining enemies after the first round of armed troops had been disposed of.

There were three opponents--two girls and one delicate-looking male, ――Despite being able to strike first against the soldiers, an outright force, Todd did not consider it to be the best outcome.

Rather, he accepted that the results of the war had been minimal.

Originally, the reason why Todd left his post and ventured into the enemy camp was to take out an opponent who was demonstrating extraordinary capabilities in information warfare ――someone who would be a nuisance in this battle for the Imperial Capital.

In a large-scale battle of this magnitude, the handling of accurate information is vital to a successful outcome.

Frankly, Todd believed that this was the main reason why the Imperial Army, with its solid defenses and Nine Divine Generals of incredible strength, continued to be undermined by rebels whose only advantage was their numbers.

If we were the human body, the commander of the group is either the head or the heart. Both are fatal if crushed, and everyone knows this, so they try to protect them as a matter of course. However, no matter how hard the head and heart work, if the vessels that circulate the flowing blood do not function, the body will not be able to function.

In this sense, the most important enemy to eliminate is the one who is the vessel on the battlefield, and who is responsible for deciding the course of the battle.

Todd: [That’s easy to answer for women and children being on the battlefield, which fits the residents of the Imperial City perfectly. Besides, ain’t that a bit too convenient.]

Todd appraises his opponent, exchanging words that should not be exchanged.

The three opponents appear as described above, but there is no proof as to which of them is the vessel that Todd is wary of.

The two young girls hardly seem appropriate for the battlefield.

Looking in their early teens, The Flying Dragon General, Madelyn Eschart is not so different in appearance, but unlike her, who is instantly recognizable as a being of a higher level, both girls appear to be human.

However, the fact that there is a presence that should not be there also causes one to doubt that the girls have to be here as they are.

Todd: [If you were a non-combatant who was just left behind on the battlefield, your current logic might hold. But I don’t recognize a man who serves on the battlefield as a non-combatant.]

On the other hand, the gentle-looking man who exchanged words openly is not a warrior, but he is the closest to the impression of a vessel that Todd has in mind.

In terms of powerlessness, he is not much different from the girls, but there is something off about the way he looks at them. A shrewd look, the kind that makes one's own life into a tool with impunity, hiding behind a thin facade.

He cannot let his eyes be drawn to the gentle-looking man, nor can he let his guard down for the two girls.

One of the girls has an oddly determined look in her eyes, and the other unmistakably has the wariness of a warrior in her posture and the way she holds herself, although this is not unusual in Vollachia, where the latter has probably already taken a life or two.

If one has experience in killing, even if they are a girl, they have overcome the wall of resolve.

In other words, you can never be too careful.

Todd: [Who knows. But my gut is telling me. You are the root of all evil in this war. And my gut also tells me this.]

Three opponents, all of whom cause Todd to be wary in three different ways.

The lack of planning to look for or create an opening for Todd as they converse is also not acceptable. --It is hard to say who is the most important target.

Todd: [――It’s better not to waste time with you guys either.]

They were all targets that needed to be killed, was Todd's irrefutable conclusion.

△▼△▼△▼△

――-Otto Suwen often curses his own carelessness.

The situation in which Natsuki Subaru and Rem disappeared, thus leading them to come to the Vollachian Empire, was the most significant, but there were also many other things to reflect on.

The part Petra had just rebuked him for was also one matter which he needed to reflect deeply.

Using the Divine Protection of Soul Language to dominate the battlefield in this imperial siege.

This policy, which he had declared confidently and carried out with the help of Petra, changed the shape of the battlefield without prejudice or conceit.

The power of the Divine Protection of Soul Language, combined with Otto's hearing being magnified by Petra's yang magic - keeps track of ever-changing battlefield formations and positions, and provides ongoing information.

Of course, the information gathered is a useless treasure if it cannot be used accurately, but personality aside, Abel has met Otto's expectations in terms of his abilities and has used it with great skill.

Too few people know how much Otto's work contributes to this battlefield, but Otto was not concerned with the evaluation.

In any case, nothing that happened in the Vollachian Empire can be divulged to the outside world.

If this were within the Kingdom of Lugunica, it would be worth publicizing, but an evaluation of our work in the empire is a useless risk. So evaluation is secondary.

Otto: [All we need is a result to bring back Natsuki-san and Rem. …and also without sacrifice.]

It would be a real disaster if one of us were to be killed in order to bring Subaru and Rem back home.

That is the first prerequisite for this journey, and at the same time, the most important prerequisite. ――Or, more precisely, there was no other prerequisite.

Therefore, he was prepared to employ all the cards he had in his hand on the battlefield and was admonished by Petra for his recklessness.

Otto reflected a lot on that - but it still wasn't enough.

The result of not being able to compensate for the carelessness in this way was the imperial soldier with an axe in his hand in front of him.

Todd: [――My bad, my bad, and here I was going to get them all at once.]

An Imperial soldier with a bandana wrapped around his head looked at them while gripping a long-handled axe.

Otto, with Petra on his back sheltering him, cursed his own carelessness greatly in the face of demonstrating thoroughly ruthless and pragmatic judgment.

The use of the information gathered was left to Abel, who would be able to use it best.

But the crux of information warfare lies in how to obtain the information to handle in the first place. Most of the time, people don't look at that part and are tempted to target the main body that handles the information instead.

But the man in front of him was different.

Otto: [That’s easy to answer for women and children being on the battlefield, which fits the residents of the Imperial City perfectly. Besides, ain’t that a bit too convenient.]

The man who thus appears before Otto and his comrades has clear intentions - to target Otto who gathered information, rather than the main camp where Abel utilised it.

They are a less vigilant opponent, with fewer guards, but if you take their heads, the result will be the same. The less information that's handled, the less precise Abel's command will be. There is no reason not to do it.

Otto himself would have done it if he were in the same position as his opponent.

So――,

Todd: [If you were a non-combatant who was just left behind on the battlefield, your current logic might hold. But I don’t recognize a man who serves on the battlefield as a non-combatant.]

He observed the man in detail, while feeling that his statement was reasonable.

There were two main questions: how did he show up here without being caught in Otto's channel, and how did he locate Otto and his team?

It is safe to assume that the two questions can probably be answered by the same reason.

That this man's peculiarities of some kind had allowed him to bypass the channel and locate the source of the transmission.

Todd: [Who knows. But my gut is telling me. You are the root of all evil in this war. And my gut also tells me this.]

Otto wanted to find clues to this from the conversation, but the man was thorough, as per his initial analysis.

He understood that not saying much would allow him to defend himself. Unlike the kind typical of the Empire, who used overwhelming force to defeat their opponents, he had a cunning attitude.

These enemies were formidable. -An opponent who thought he was weak was a threat.

Because of that――,

Todd: [――It’s better not to waste time with you guys either.]

The man leapt straight at him, swinging his long-handled axe.

In response, Otto gritted his teeth while pouring all his energy into avoiding the first blow. He poured it in, then braced himself. ――He wondered how far he could get against the man with minimal preparation.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Petra Leyte regretted her lack of discipline whenever she was put through adversity.

Due to her young age, Petra was often spoiled by her peers in the camp, but she had decided that it would be a different matter to resign to her position as a child and accept her own immaturity.
 
If this were because of a mistake she had made in her daily life at the mansion, in the course of her duties as a maid, she might not have had to take it so seriously.
 
However, depending on the situation, such complacency would eventually lead to a serious mistake.

Not to mention the constant nervousness.
 
However, she must at all times achieve what was expected of her. That was Petra's approach to thinking about things, or at least that was the immature ideal she aspired to.

That was why――,

Todd: [――It’s better not to waste time with you guys either.]

Trembling from head to toe, she looked up at the imperial soldier who swooped in with an axe in his hand.
 
At the edge of her vision, which was soaked with welled-up tears, she could see the charred corpse of the messenger who had been burned by raging flames.
 
If Otto had not frantically pulled her out of the way, she, too, would have lost her life. That fact left a crack in Petra’s spirit, and at the same time――,

Otto: [Petra-chan!]

As he called out her name, Petra was moved by the great faith Otto had in her.

Abandoning his attitude towards the role of a "young lady" that Petra had provisionally played, Otto's voice jolted the actual Petra and broke her free from the fear and regret petrifying her.

Thereupon――,

Otto: [――Number seven!]

At Otto's signal, Petra reflexively lifted her arm.

A moment later, Petra's mind was filled with anxiety. She had been entrusted with this role after proclaiming that she could do it, but there was no denying that it was a spur-of-the-moment course of action.
 
She had practiced the whole time. So she was aware of her own strength to fight when it came time to perform.

And then there was――,

Petra: [――Subaru.]

Calling out the name of her loved one to scatter the surplus of anxiety, she simply grit her teeth.

Petra: [――Jiwald!]

A ray of white light shot out from Petra's fingertips as she chanted this.
 
It was one of the few offensive spells within Yang Magic, a spear of light that pierced anything in its path―― but only when wielded by a first-rate master, and the inexperienced Petra did not meet that standard.

Petra's Jiwald inflicted a burn at best, rather than killing a living target.

Nevertheless, that was fine.

Petra: [――――]

The white light emitted from her fingertips was not directed at the man who had leaped at her, but at the ground diagonally behind him. It was their rehearsed move, number seven, disguised as not to look unnatural.

The goal was not to burn the man. ――The aim was to ignite what had been prepared.

Todd: [Wha-]

Otto's specialty, a ground trap using Fire Magic Stones.

Ten traps had been prepared in case Otto, who searched for enemies using open “channels,” and Petra who assisted him, were targeted.

Because of the number of magic stones, he could carry and the fact that he had to move around while searching for enemies, he could hardly be perfectly prepared. Even so, Otto had said, “You never know what might be useful," and his almost insidiously meticulous preparation now came to fruition as the ground behind the man exploded.

Todd: [――Hk.]

Instantly, the man's vigilance shifted slightly behind his back.
 
As Petra had been instructed, the explosion did not blow up under the man's feet or even close to him, so the shock and heat of the explosion did not reach him. Merely, it drew his attention backward ever so slightly.
 
That was enough for the girl looking for an opening on which to pounce.

???: [Oyraaa――!]

Swinging a barbarian sword in her hand, Medium plunged into her opponent's chest.

While not much taller than Petra, the blonde girl cut boldly into the opponent's arm with a bravery entirely different from Petra's, and began to slash away at the axe wielder's arm.

Todd: [Tsk.]

The man, distracted and clicking his tongue, twisted his wrist and quickly parried Medium's blow with his axe. They both shrugged off each other's initial blows, and got back to square one――,

Medium: [Another! Another! Anotheeerrr!]

Despite their initial expectations, Medium was not that weak-willed at all.
 
Even if her opponent's attack bounced off her sword, she used that momentum to unleash an empowered sword strike. If her opponent dodged that strike, she would use the momentum to spin around again for yet another sword strike.
 
The sword dance was like an unstoppable flow of water from a rising river――,

Otto: [Number four!]

Petra: [Yes.]

Tapping the captivated Petra on the shoulder, Otto's next instruction came flying in. 
 
Once the signal was given, she would shoot magic at the designated spot without thinking. ――When she agreed to accompany Otto on his travels around the battlefield, she was told that this was the most important condition.
 
Therefore, Petra was determined to follow those instructions, forgetting all fears and anything else.

Petra: [Jiwald!]

The magic was released once again, but this time the ground exploded at a much closer spot than before.
 
Perhaps the man may have thought they would avoid embroiling Medium since they were in the middle of crossing swords. But that was a naive thought.

Otto: [If necessary, we will involve Medium-san.]

Petra: [I'll cast a healing spell on you later, okay?]

Medium: [Uoooh!I don't really get it, but I can't stop now!]

The explosion detonated a few meters away and struck them in a way betraying such naiveté.
 
Ruthless as it may have been, Petra agreed with Otto's way of thinking. The reality of survival by accepting some wounds was more important than the ideal scenario of them getting through unscathed.

Despite her skin being scorched by the heat of the explosion, Medium's momentum never stopped.
 
With a sense of gratitude and guilt, Petra and Otto gave their all to defeat this assassin――,

Todd: [Oi, oi, give me a break.]

The moment they looked closer, the man said this within the sound of the explosion.
 
It sounded awfully clear, and there was not even a sliver of anger or impatience from having suffered any setback. It was more like a strange, out-of-place sentiment.
 
Rather, the man's voice was filled with exasperation.

Todd: [Are we thinking the same thing?]

The moment Petra heard that, goosebumps ran all over her body.
 
Even without understanding these words, the intent behind them felt clear as day.

Otto: [Number two!]

Just when Petra was about to realize the true nature of the shiver in a little more detail, at Otto's scream she promptly abandoned all thought and immediately obeyed.
 
The Jiwald she fired off transferred heat to the magic stone hidden in the ground, just as before. ――However, Petra's finger was now pointing beneath their own feet.

Petra: [――――]

A white light flashed under their feet, turning red and causing a shockwave.
 
After doing it, Petra realized that it was an emergency escape plan, something that Otto had prefaced with, "I would rather not use it because it will hurt."
 
And in fact, Petra's small body was launched into the air as her soles bounced off the overflowing light. However, she did not ascend unprotected.

Gripped by an arm that reached out with a "Guh," Petra's body was embraced by Otto's slender frame.
 
Of course, Otto's body was also sent flying by the same impact, but Otto chose to avoid making the mistake of flying away in a direction where they would be separated and unable to support each other, or at least to minimize the damage Petra's body would suffer.

Otto's decision allowed Petra not to complain nor stiffen, but to use Yang Magic as quickly and strongly as possible, to make Otto's body as resistant to impact as possible.

By doing this, their bodies bounced off the ground. Immediately after that――,

Petra: [――――]

With a bang, a powerful detonation exploded at the same spot where Petra and Otto had been until just before.

Catching a glimpse of the identity behind the explosion sound, Petra's eyes witnessed a flame which seemed to be the same thing that had burned the two messengers.

Said flame aimed to burn Petra and the others from behind.

Petra: [That axe…]

He made them think that he was going to cut down Petra and the others, but his real goal was the Fire Magic Stones planted behind them.

The man's refusal to engage in a head-on confrontation was his specialty, and the fact that it overlapped with Otto's preparedness was probably the true explanation behind the man's grumblings.

Petra: [Tch!]

Petra almost simultaneously arrived at the same thought as Otto, who was tumbling to the ground while holding Petra in his arms.

Otto grunted in pain as he rolled on the hard ground and bit his teeth while being bombarded by shockwaves. However, Otto immediately got to his knees on the spot and turned to face the man while lifting up Petra’s body.

Petra also supported Otto's body and glared at the man who was some distance away.

However, contrary to the concerns of Petra and the others, the man did not immediately give chase.

They understood right away why that was as well as his intention behind it.

Todd: [I don't really want to do that, though.]

While spilling that out, the man with an axe pointed at them and turned his head to check.

The man sniffed at the scent of burning grass turning into black smoke as he felt under his feet where the explosion had occurred.

Todd: [There, and there. And then, over there.] 

Petra widened her eyes at what followed, after the man had quietly muttered something.

The man had turned his head, and the ground had exploded in his line of sight. It was number six. Then the ninth and the first, followed by the fifth and the eighth, and so on.

Petra: [B-But how…]

Otto: [...No way, a Spirit?]

It was a surprise that he had seen through the traps’ hiding places, but they could not comprehend how he had blown them up.

Otto's words made Petra gasp at the mysterious method of the man, who showed no signs of using magic the same way as Petra had induced the explosion.

If he were a Spiritual Arts User, that would make him the same as Subaru and Emilia.

From Petra’s perspective, she was severely reluctant to admit the man in front of her as the same kind of person as two people whom she loved so dearly in many ways――,

Petra: [But, there is no Spirit to be seen here…]

Todd: [There's more than one way to get them to comply. If they don't want to be eaten, that is.]

Petra: [Eh?]

Otto: [I'm not just saying this out of spite, but it's probably for the best if we don’t listen to him.]

Petra, who couldn't understand his reply, froze with wide eyes. And then, with a tap on her shoulders, Otto immediately brought her back to her senses.

It was impossible to tell whether the man’s reply was intended to create an opening or whether he was partly telling them the truth.

However, one thing could be said for certain.

Petra: [I despise you.]

Medium: [I feel the same!]

In response to Petra, a small shadow flew, clenching her fists tightly whilst shouting.

It was Medium, who had been wary of the mysterious man's peculiar skill so she chose an opportune moment to strike. She slipped into the smoke created by the series of explosions the man had set off, and aimed at her opponent's back by lunging her barbarian sword all the way from the other side.

After patiently enduring for a long time, her bold blow went straight for the man's back――,

Todd: [Of the three of you, you're the easiest to read.]

Medium: [――Ah.]

Leaning his body to the side, the man had escaped the downward trajectory of the barbarian sword.

Just like that, the man turned himself around and thrust his axe toward Medium, who was behind him.

Todd: [You're the only one who does things the imperial Way. It's absolutely sickening.]

Petra: [Medium-chan!]

The sight of the man's relentless axe was absorbed by the screaming Petra, who was trailing behind, and Medium's wide-eyed face.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Medium O'Connell did not put too much thought into all of this.

Strictly speaking, Medium had a lot to think about on her own.

She was always worried about her brother, Flop O'Connell, and at the same time she trusted him. When she heard that he had been taken away from the Fortress City, the surprise and worry were enough that her chest was about to burst; but her brother would have probably panicked if he had known her body had shrunk while she was on her own.

So she thought that they were about even in terms of worry and trust.

Flop: [Dear sister! Rather than racking our brains, we arrive at way better solutions when we think with our hearts. That seems especially the case for you, so keep that in mind!]

Those words that her brother had said considerably earlier served as an important guiding light within Medium, irrespective of whether her chest shrunk or not.

Since thinking about things with the heart tended to be linked to completely nonsensical, outrageous statements, it was also detested by some. Abel, in particular, seemed to find it quite disagreeable.

But what her brother said was great. In fact, this approach had worked out great for Medium.

Medium: [As expected, big bro is awesome!]

Of course, if that made everything go well, she wouldn’t have become smaller, her brother wouldn’t have been taken to the capital, Rem wouldn’t have disappeared, Natsumi wouldn’t have been flung away, Chaosflame wouldn’t have been destroyed, and Emily and the others wouldn’t have been all over the place, probably.

There was no way everything would go well.

However, as far as Medium’s actions were concerned, it was the best way to achieve the optimal outcome.

For that reason, the moment an axe had swung violently at her defenseless face after her surprise attack from behind had failed, Medium did not panic, even while thinking, “Ah, I’m dead.”

It was similar to feeling no regret after taking the best possible action and fulfilling one’s role to the end, but one would still end up losing because the outcome was inevitable.

Of course, she hated the thought of dying here since it would leave her heartbroken after being unable to reunite with her brother, and she was full of regret for not being able to help her new friends like Rem and Natsumi.

However, after thinking through things with her heart, Medium took the best possible bargain she could.

The results came down, for want of a better word, to luck――if it didn’t work out, her life was forfeit, as it was the way of the world here in Vollachia.

However――,

Medium: [――――]

Just before it slashed her face, the thick axe blade sparked and was repelled.

While just barely feeling the scent of steel in her nose, Medium exhaled slightly,

Medium: [As expected, big bro is awesome. I haven’t even died once doing things this way.]

???: [――Oh, I'm jealous of that. I've completely lost count.]

Medium, expressing how the method her brother had taught her saved her once again, was answered by the person who had bounced away the axe that should have taken her life.

What had been swung was the Blue Dragon Sword that was as thick as the axe that was repelled―― The person gripping it was quite strange, with his appearance earning high marks from Medium’s perspective.

Todd: [You’re...]

Todd turned his gaze to the person that had stepped in, the man who protected Medium when she was sure to have been killed and who had moved his lips in displeasure.

The man who interrupted him―― a one-armed wanderer with a jet-black helmet hiding his face said, "Sorry to interrupt your good mood.”

One-Armed Man: [I was wondering where things looked worst, but as people say, “It’s darkest right below the lamp post.” But man, is it seriously troubling when the future is this dark.]

Todd: [――――]

The man who had quietly come to kill the non-combatants assumed a cautious stance.

However, it was not the stance of a lion cutting corners against a rabbit, but that of a hunter who was wary that the rabbit had disguised itself as something else, and seeing that, the wanderer―― Al shrugged.

And then――,

Al: [The future is pitch black, and I can't do anything about it. After all, I can't even see the stars.]

Thus, he had declared his participation in this battle.
