*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

When Berstetz Fondalfon noticed something strange and returned to the throne room, he found that the door to the most venerable room in the Crystal Palace was firmly closed.

"Close" does not mean the mere opening and closing of the door.

In this case, "close" literally meant the complete isolation of the door from the outside world. It was a manifestation of the intention of the master of the palace to never let anyone else enter.

However――,

???: [――In this case, whiich~ of the two is appropriate to consider the Emperor’s intention, which do you believe, Esteemed Prime Minister?]

Standing in front of the closed door, Berstetz's threadbare eyes narrowed even more extremely at the clownish manner of the effeminate man with his arms outstretched, and he came to a stop.

The man standing there with a thin smile on his face was a kind of exception who was allowed to enter and leave the Crystal Palace because of his "Stargazer" peculiarity​, an unexpected being who had obtained a position that was neither friend nor foe.

Berstetz: [Ubilk-dono, regarding the throne room…]

Ubilk: [I’m not unkind, so I’ll tell you the truth. His Imperial Highness the Emperor is here. The real and the fake are both here, you coould~ say they’re taking their time to meet face-to-face.]

Berstetz: [...I don't understand.]

To the improbably imaginative answer, Berstetz placed his hand on his chin.

As he said, "I don’t understand," there was no doubt that the situation was difficult for him to accept. At Berstetz's reaction, Ubilk tilted his head, saying, "You don’t understand?”

Ubilk: [What's so hard to accept? Are you wondering how the real Emperor was brought here? If that’s the case, I was guided by the whisper of the stars…]

Berstetz: [Even on the battlefield, you can choose to walk down a path that is free from falling arrows. Even if soldiers are slashing at each other in close quarters, you would be able to step through the place, and no blood splatter would reach you, let alone their sword blows, right?]

Ubilk: [Yeah, that's hooow~ it is. But not only that.]

Ubilk nodded with a smirk, making no pretense of hiding anything.

As ridiculous as it sounded, Berstetz had seen the abnormal abilities of Ubilk with his own eyes.

Ubilk once literally walked through a rainstorm of projectiles in the Sword Forest with ease without a scratch. Ubilk claimed that he followed the whisperings of the stars, but Berstetz could not determine whether this was true or if it was a lie about his superhuman fighting skills.

If one thing was clear, it was that a force beyond human knowledge surrounded him, whether it was the whispering of the stars or Ubilk's own abilities.

And because he was useful, neither the real Vincent Vollachia nor the fake Vincent Vollachia was willing to let go of Ubilk.

In full――,

Berstetz: [You will prevent the Great Disaster that will eventually come and serve as a guiding light for that purpose.]

Ubilk: [Ooh~, are you evaluating my humanity?]

Berstetz: [I think that only General First-Class Goz would have been called up to the Crystal Palace because of his humanity. With the exception of him, for everyone else it would be due to their abilities. I am no exception.]

Attachments to individuals were nothing more than the sounds of flying insects that should be ignored from the perspective of running a nation.

That was Berstetz's view and it was almost certainly the same view held by both Vincent Vollachias.

It was not a question of good or bad or likes and dislikes, but a topic that should be discussed from the point of view of whether it was necessary or not.

In that regard, Berstetz was only a necessary piece at this point. If he became an unnecessary person who was not worth keeping, he had no qualms about being removed.

Ubilk, too, should not deviate from his required role regardless of his resolve.

Berstetz: [If you were aware of this, you would not have overlooked the plot against him and His Excellency who now sits on the throne, would you?]

Ubilk: [Perhaps you consider my actions to be a betrayal? Thaaat’s~ complicated. After all, in order to betray, you have to be trusted first. You’ll believe me, won't you?]

Berstetz: [No, good grief.]

Ubilk: [Right? It hurts me to say it, but…]

Ubilk placed his hands on his forehead saying it hurts, but he looked amused. Whether it was placidity or something else, Berstetz had never seen his expression falter.

He had never thought of his expression as objectionable before but at this moment, for the first time, he found him an eyesore.

The real Vincent Vollachia, who was banished from the Crystal Palace and had given up his title as emperor――now he had been brought through the door and drawn to the decisive scene.

Ubilk: [Let me answer one question, Esteemed Prime Minister...I haven't changed my standpoint.]

Berstetz: [――Your standpoint, which is?]

Berstetz asked whether he intended to claim to be a friend or foe. When Ubilk heard that, he put his hands together in front of his chest, making a sound,

Ubilk: [Of course, I wish to defeat the "Great Disaster" and maintain the peace and quiet of the Vollachian Empire.]

Berstetz: [――. For that reason, you believe that the confrontation on the other side of this door is necessary.]

Ubilk: [Yes, that’s right, that’s right. Everything I do is for the sake of that. ――The beating of my heart, the breathing that inflates and deflates my lungs, the flow of blood going up and down, everything.]

Berstetz: [――――]

Berstetz was silenced by Ubilk, who continued with his hand tapping on his own chest.

Ubilk's unchanging smile, unwavering demeanor, and somewhat devilish gaze seemed sane and serious to Berstetz's eyes.

Whether that sanity and seriousness was a peek into the other side of madness was not certain.

Berstetz: [――Your Excellency, what will you do?]

As Ubilk stood guarding the great door and the two emperors were facing each other on the other side of it ――Berstetz muttered to himself, thinking of the person he had banished.

Berstetz did not care if he were beheaded, if his soul were scorched, or if he were subjected to any other kind of brutal execution.

If Vincent Vollachia, one of the wisest emperors in the history of the Empire, truly wanted to be emperor, so be it.

Therefore――,

△▼△▼△▼△

Vincent: [A man who is always quick to act and light in words. I would not count on something of the ilk of the Stargazer, who placed his faith in the skies above.]

Abel: [Firstly, I expect no sort of loyalty from that thing. If hierarchy were to be established based on loyalty, Vollachia would not have been upheld till the present day. But then again…]

Vincent: [――――]

Abel: [Had my ruin come as a result of being unable to question the upsides and downsides of the ambitions you have hidden, then one can easily say it’s but natural that the prospect of me stepping through the Palace floor like this would be one so far off in the distance.]

Treading upon the blood-like red carpet, so inquired Abel of the one before his eyes, the former’s gaze fixed on the latter, arms crossed.

There was no room for debate as to whose hand had aided Abel in this instance of arriving at this place. That man, who read through the peculiarities of that which was outside the norm, pouring heart and soul into realizing the wishes of the Observers, was without peer in regards to the act of treading the outside of the game board.

Much akin to a loose arrow. However, an arrow that could not be divested of its station lest the conditions were to be met.

Identifying the conditions for forcefully divesting that loose arrow of its post had been a particularly difficult task to the extreme, being that making it stir was a two-edged sword. Yet, he had done it.

The fact that he was now setting foot on the throne room from which he had been ousted from once more, was proof of that.

The scheming, the concealment till this moment, it was no exaggeration to state that it had all been done in order to wrestle back this opportunity.

Abel: [――――]

The face of the man sitting on the throne he had his eyes set on, the one to whom that question had been posed, was one Abel had seen many times.

His own face, it was. The logic as to why transcended mere intimacy with said face.

It was a visage that to others would appear like that of Vincent Vollachia himself, however, to Abel, who had known the man who had mastered the art of disguising himself with that face for years, it appeared to be a poorly-crafted mask.

A mask would remain a mask however, even if poorly crafted.

A mask over one’s face concealed their true nature, accomplishing the role of covering up the real thoughts and making them invisible. Henceforth, Abel posed his questions not with his eyes, but with his words.

And in addition, he posed straightforward, piercing questions, ones devoid of any smoke and mirrors.

Abel: [――Have your wishes in ousting me, thus joining Berstetz, come true?]

The query spoke by Abel, had anyone heard it, was one that seemed sure to have caused outrage.

The aftermath of the banishment drama that had begun in a room in the Crystal Palace had already spread throughout the entirety of the Empire. Even now, Imperial Soldiers and rebels were clashing on the walls surrounding the Imperial Capital, their lives continuously being scattered to the wind.

The people living in the Imperial Capital, too, were entrusting their lives on the outcome.

Against this backdrop, Abel's question was the sort that could not escape being criticized for being leisurely.

Still, Abel had voiced so. The rebel, who preferred not wasting a single thing, who had worked out so many wily schemes to get to this point, had voiced so; because it was necessary.

To determine what Abel―― Nay, the real Vincent Vollachia, ought to seek in the coming dialogue with the fake Vincent Vollachia.

Finally, after hesitating for a long time, an interval far too short to be dubbed contemplation――,

Vincent: [No, not yet. I have not yet obtained the result I seek.]

In a voice imitative of the one that had cast the voice, thus was the answer from the false Emperor to the true Emperor.

Abel: [――――]

A moment of time was needed once more, on the matter of that reply, for Abel.

He paused for a breath, interrupted by what could be neither hesitation nor contemplation.

And then――,

Abel: [Have yet to obtain what you seek, is it?]

As that spilled from him, he closed both his eyes. ――Going against the natural habit he had.

Abel never closed both eyes simultaneously. He was forced to keep one eye open at all times, or his preparations would be far too deficient, left to rule an Empire lifeless after the blink of an eye.

For Abel, who by-product of training and self-awareness, was capable of keeping one eye open even when sleeping, his consciousness remaining half-awake, this marked the first time in several years in which he shut both eyes closed, and the darkness arrived.

By doing so, by possessing the very capability of doing so, Abel had made an assertion of his own intents.

In other words,

Abel: [That is deceit.]

From the moment he had set foot into the throne room, no anger, no disappointment had been present within Abel’s voice and gaze both. The same applied even when it came to being before the man who had performed an act of treachery, stabbing him in the back. His steely self-control had allowed him to do so.

Here, Abel’s voice, which had rejected emotionality entirely, Abel's voice, was laced with a hue for the first time.

A hue of disdain which he stopped attempting to conceal, directed towards the person who had disguised himself in his own visage.

Vincent: [――――]

With those words spoken, the false Emperor, warming his throne, kept his silence.

守る、だ。その無言で守るものが、つまらない矜持であればまだ救いようもあったが。
Silent, he kept. It would have helped if his mute defense had been a trifling pride of place.

Abel: [Ousting myself from the throne, you removed Goz from the equation as he had gained knowledge of the situation, crushed the plans I had concocted after my escape in anticipation,  and took part in the destruction of the Demon City. The smoldering flames have grown, spreading onto the entire nation, The growing fire has spread to the whole country, permitting that the bounds of the Imperial Capital, a place where rebels armed with their designs of insurrection had never been allowed to reach, would at last have the dirty feet of the boor enter it.]

Vincent: [Do you believe it would have not come to pass, had it been yourself on the throne?]

Abel: [To begin with, had I been on the throne, all this now would not have come to fruition. As a result, the conflagration you have brought upon has swept over the Empire. However.]

Thereupon cutting off his sentence, Abel extended his hand towards the oni mask that covered his face.

And then――,

Abel: [――A way to immediately extinguish these flames exists.]

Having spoken so, he ripped off the mask affixed to his face, thus exposing his real face to open air within eyesight of the other person.

The two Emperors faced one another, their faces in every way identical, like two peas in a pod, their visages looking down in each other’s direction. Real and fake, a perfect mirror such that none would be able to detect discrepancies.

Abel: [――――]

He was a wise man. Abel's actions and words had certainly conveyed his intentions clearly.

With matters having come this far, he had sufficient understanding of his disadvantageous position, of the difficulty in fulfilling his plan. It was time for waves of reason to sweep away the schemes that had been hatched, even if these waves were to be resisted.

If the obstacles they had set their eyes on, if the Great Disaster to be fought against were both the same, that would be only logical.

Henceforth――,

Abel: [I shall…]

He was about to announce his intent to return to where he was supposed to be.

He would issue a decree difficult to oppose, thus settling the battle initiated by foolish reasons.

And, it happened just prior to that.

Vincent: [――Your Excellency.]

That one expression, cut off Abel’s words at the start.

It was an expression that ought not be stated, with that appearance, with that voice. Deprecating oneself and putting the one it was directed at a higher standing, it was a stupid statement from someone who had lost awareness of his own position, which ought not happen.

The moment it was heard, Abel's words were interrupted for a beat.

Perhaps that was the second time Abel―― No, Vincent Vollachia, had had his expectations betrayed in the Crystal Palace, a possibly fatal moment.

On the first occasion, he had been ousted from the throne. And now, on this second instance――,

Vincent: [――――]

Slipping into that momentary gap, the false Emperor rose from the throne.

Raising himself from his sitting position, the difference in their heights, which had been only that of one looking down on the other, once more increased for a smidgen. However, that notion vanished in a blink’s worth of time. No more did it matter.

The reason for that, being――,

Vincent: [――Your one lapse was in having a bird’s-eye view of the board.]

The figure informing him of this had closed the distance in the time of a sole breath, looming before Abel.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Inside the Crystal Palace in the Imperial Capital of Lupugana, two emperors, one true and one false, are within breathtaking distance of each other.

At that moment, simultaneous changing events occur at various parts of the siege of the Imperial Capital.

Each was caused by different feelings and beliefs, but one thing was common to all of them.

One thing was that none of the changes in any of the circumstances were desirable.

???: [――El Fula.]

Wielding a wand in their hand, they creates a gust of wind in the thirsty air of the battlefield.

Ordinarily, this magic would focus on precisely slitting the opponent's throat with minimal effort. However, Ram realized that this would not be effective against the enemy on this battlefield.

Forming a horde, standing in their way were stone golems that did not seem to have a life of their own.

They have no self-consciousness, and although they are humanoid in shape, they attack approaching objects mechanically, lacking what one would call vital points of the human body.

Whether it be removing their heads or severing their limbs, they attack their enemies using the remaining parts of their body as weapons.

Therefore, Ram's signature tactics are ineffective.

But she can't be a pretty damsel as to just sit back and not fight.

???: [Let loose――!]

In response to Ram's glare at the horde, a line of brown-skinned war maidens also push forward on the front line. The People of Shudraq push forward unafraid of the battlefield, their bows poised, their arrows drawn, and their shots fired at the encroaching obstacles of stone.

Applying her wind to each of their arrows, Ram forcefully scatters the problem.

The wind-borne arrow had been given speed and rotation, and the moment it struck the stone golem, the arrowhead had burst the wind at the point where it bit, and the penetrating force created had shattered the stone golem.

The arrow, which had never run out of power, had pierced directly into the stone golems behind it in a chain reaction, causing the same destruction and increasing the damage.

With a single arrow released, the battle results in two to three stone golems being dropped.

In addition to that――,

Ram: [Fula.]

The whispered, delicate chanting had created a wind of a different wavelength than the wind to destroy, and it had blown through the earth, which was strewn with scattered stone blocks, as if to caress it.

At once, the arrows that had destroyed by the stone golems and fallen to the ground, had flown up and returned to the hands of the running Shudraqs. They had been nocked, released, and then defeated the stone golems. The process had repeated itself.

Ram: [Fula, El Fula, Fula, El Fula.]

The alternate chanting, the rapid use of magic in succession, and the subtle movements of the same system of magic had already been employed.

Shudraq, who had nothing but respect and admiration for the mastery of the art of warfare in the Vollachian Empire, but had been left behind in the development of magic, had no idea of the extraordinary skill involved.

With eyes closed, she had threaded the needle without using her hands. It is said that it would been a superhuman feat to thread the same number of threads through ten or twenty holes at the same time.

With the arrival of Ram and her wind magic having proven its efficacy, Shudraq's breakthrough power had swelled several fold.

The women warriors, having been left behind by Zikr Osman's faith and sentiments, had used their consequently preserved strength to crush the forces that would have sealed the third bastion.

???: [Aah, how pleasant! I'm going to shock both friend and foe!]

With glossy black daggers gripped in her hands, Mizelda said that as she raced across the battlefield.

Although she had a prosthetic leg in place of the one she had lost, her unfaltering gait gave no sense of deficiency. Mizelda overtook the frontline of the battlefield where the arrows of her allies flew about mercilessly, and swinging the daggers in both hands, she smashed the stone golems like a storm and opened a hole in their group.

???: [Sister will dodge them on her own! Don't stop! Let Ram’s wind carry our spirit!]

Taritta, who herself had a bow in hand, fired three shots in the time the other Shudraqians took to fire one, and with her eyes fixed on the back of her older sister rampaging on the front lines, she made an appeal to her brethren.

In accordance with that, when the arrows of the Shudraqians dealt a crushing blow to the group of stone golems, Zikr and the others who had gathered lives that should have been thrown away, charged in to destroy their battle formation.

???: [Move, move, move! You small fry stone golems, don’t take over the battlefield!]

Letting loose a vulgar voice at the head of the group, there was a man with elegant, flowing swordsmanship contrary to his apparent character. With a killing sweep through the stone golems, the man with an eye patch leveled the battlefield in a single move.

If one went by what had been described so far, it was a war situation that could probably be called overwhelming superiority.

However――,

Zikr: [Pull back――!!]

Mounted on the back of a galewind horse with a beautiful coat, Zikr shouted, and the group running on the front lines immediately split up. Right after, a “wall” fell from overhead towards the center of that group.

A thunderous roar and violent tremor engulfed the land, a phenomenon that without exaggeration, was like fighting the fort itself―― the threat of Moguro Hagane, who had become one with the city wall, would not diminish no matter how many golems were chipped away

Literally, with one swing of Moguro's arm, the progress of the battle they pushed into was pushed back in the blink of an eye.

Rather than seesawing evenly, the battle had been unfolding with one step forward, followed by two steps back.

But――,

Ram: [――What?]

Ram, who had been concentrating on advancing forward on the battlefield, delivering arrows to the Shudraq and having their arrows pierced through the enimy, narrowed her light-crimson eyes and pondered the changes that had taken place.

It was only Ram at first to notice the signs, but gradually it became a change that caught everyone's attention, a change in the battlefield over the third bastion.

Change, that was--,

???: [――Fuck you! Don't turn your back on your enemy! You're still a General First-Class!]

Moguro Hagane, who has become a huge, misshapen figure, is struck in the back by vulgar swearing.

Yes, to their back. --Moguro Hagane, who took a giant step toward the Imperial City, turning his back on Ram, the Shudraqians, and the throngs of warriors he encountered on the battlefield.

???: [It's no good! She won't wake up at all!]

Shaking her shoulders, shouting at her, and lightly tapping her cheeks do not awaken the limp dragonkin girl in her arms ――Madelyn Eschart.

Emilia, after retrieving her from the snow, where she lay motionless, was trying her best to make the hectic battlefield a little better, but she was unable to get any results.

Emilia: [Mezoreia is…]

Emilia, her silver hair fluttering in the cold wind, held Madelyn, still locked in a stubborn sleep with her eyes closed, and when she turned around, she saw that a battle was taking place between two extraordinary beings.

On the other side is a dragon clad in clouds that is separated from ordinary creatures by its very existence.

While the other is a little boy who looks and talks like a small child, the blue-haired boy is flying around the battlefield with a fighting style that would put any adult or Emilia to shame.

The battle between the Cloud Dragon Mezoreia and Cecilus Segmunt was now a legendary one.

Cecilus: [Shuwa!]

With the soles of his Zoried feet on the icy wall without any apparent aid, Cecilus's body runs through the air at an angle parallel to the ground.

Without anything to hold on to, the human body would normally fall to the ground. Yet, Cecilus ignores such natural principles and makes use of the towering ice wall as a foothold from which to approach the dragon above Emilia’s head.

Taking one last powerful step, Cecilus' body catches up to Mezoreia with lightning speed.

Mezoreia flapped their wings and tried to keep their distance, but they were at the mercy of his maneuvers and were defenselessly hit by the slash of an ice sword to their open neck after avoiding the swinging claws.

Mezoreia: [GIAAAAAAU]

The dragon's cry of anguish, not unlike a dragon's, and the high-pitched sound of the ice sword shattering at the dragon's neck had conveyed the end result to those around it through sound. Was it the robustness of the Cloud Dragon's scales that shattered the ice blade, which had been hardened like iron, or was it the sword speed of Cecilus that shattered the ice blade?

In any case, the shattered ice sword had done its job, leaving the hollow Cecilus unprotected――,

Cecilus: [All you can see, all you can do! There are no limits, no petty tricks!]

The high-pitched voice, comparable to the sound of an ice sword shattering, had been an indication of Cecilus' natural voice and the excitement of his feelings.

Cecilus's words, spun in a pleasant tone, had been followed by a second ice-shattering sound―― no, not two, but three or four in succession.

Cecilus: [Chaichaichaichaichai!]

Cecilus, who leapt up, thinking he was unprotected in the air, had not been outdone.

He had pulled out a myriad of ice weapons created by Emilia―― Icicle Line weapons one after another, and had shoved them into his clothes.

The items Cecilus had picked up while catching up with Mezoreia, which was escaping into the sky, had been waved one after another by Cecilus' hands in the air, peeling off Mezoreia's scales.

Swords, axes, spears, and hammers of ice had been flying wildly and furiously, and the Cloud Dragon was unable to defend itself against their fury. Or maybe even that expression was wrong because it couldn’t be prevented.

Emilia: [Wow…]

But if Cecilus were to move right in front of her, Emilia would probably not be able to follow his afterimage.

With that level of surprise, maybe Cecilus will be able to defeat Mezoreia even if Madelyn doesn't wake up.

If that’s the case, she wouldn’t be without a mind to think so, though.

Emilia: [You're fighting for someone you care about, too, aren't you?]

Emilia lowered the corners of her amethyst eyes at the sight of Madelyn's unconscious sleeping face.

Madelyn has always been hostile, angry, and not willing to listen, but Emilia didn't know her well enough to dislike her for it.

Understandably, the reason she is angry was because of her feelings for someone she cares about, and Mezoreia had come down to help Madelyn in this way.

If this Mezoreia were to die while she was asleep, what kind of situation would Madelyn's mind be forced into?

Emilia: [Madelyn, wake up! Wake up!]

They are in the middle of a battle. And Cecilus, moreover, saved Emilia's life, despite the perilous situation.

It was impossible to be so selfish as to ask him to back off or not to kill Mezoreia.

So, Madelyn is the only one who might be able to end this battle without losing the lives of either Madelyn herself or Mezoreia, who has come to her rescue.

Cecilus: [Oh, I see! So the base of the wing is weak!]

Despite Emilia's hopes, the analysis of Cecilus, who had been applauding the battle, proceeded.

Looking back at her memories of fighting Volcanica, Emilia had had no idea of the dragon creature's weaknesses, but Cecilus had seemed to think differently.

Cecilus' sword strike had hit the base of the dragon's wing as he said, as he continued to fight in the air with the dragon's body as a foothold, not falling out of the air and dodging the attack of the wings and tail that tried to fling him away.

Instantly, the kind of scream changed, and blue blood dripped onto the white snow-covered ground.

Beyond the stubborn scales, there was proof that a slash had gone through them.

Cecilus: [If a dragon lost its wings, what would make it different from a ground dragon? Have you had a chance to learn how to fight on the ground in your long lifetime?]

He was not mocking or belittling.

Cecilus' tone of voice had remained the same; if anything, he was saying it to make himself feel better. But even Emilia was convinced that what he had been saying was about to become a reality.

If Emilia was convinced, Mezoreia, who was being directly swung by the sword, should have been even more convinced.

A dragon with its wings cut off and falling to the ground.

Emilia, who had no wings and was not a dragon, couldn’t imagine how unbearable that would be. But she could see how it would make Mezoreia's chances of winning less likely.

It was hard to believe that Cecilus, who couldn’t be chased even in the sky, could be chased on the ground.

Mezoreia: [――I, the Dragon!]

A moment later, Mezoreia's low voice had exploded, trying to beat back the humiliation that had loomed before it.

Kicking Mezoreia in the stomach, Cecilus leapt up and slashed at the root of its wing. Just before it hit, Cecilus did a spinning cone rub and flipped from prone to prone in mid-air.

Mezoreia's dragon arm reared up in front of Cecilus, who aimed for the wing.

A human body could easily be torn apart if either the claws or the scales were hooked.

Emilia almost screamed that even Cecilus, who could move fast, was no exception. But Emilia's scream was not at the death of Cecilus, but at another sight.

Emilia: [Oh no, that was a close one!]

The swinging dragon arm had certainly caught Cecilus in mid-air.

However, Cecilus met the sole of his foot against the dragon's arm that hit him, running through the arm that had struck him with a ferocious blow.

He began running from near the dragon's elbow, using the tip of the dragon’s claw as a foothold for launching himself.

He was hit directly, converting the impact that would have blown his body apart into something to run through and jump out of the way. His ridiculous foot speed allowed him to escape a death that should have been inevitable.

Cecilus: [Beautiful lady-san!]

Emilia: [Ah, yes!]

While being called beautiful, she forgot to say any words of modesty in response to how she was called.

Instinctively sensing who was being called, Emilia leapt from the end of the dragon's arm and cast a new ice weapon in the vicinity of Cecilus, who landed on the ice wall.

Cecilus quickly picked it up and turned to Mezoreia, intending to pursue it, and bent his knees in preparation for another leap.

The open distance, which could be closed in the blink of an eye, was Mezoreia’s chance of victory, a position where no attacks from Cecilus could ever reach.

Naturally, Mezoreia would also put all of its energy into this. ――At least it should have been.

Cecilus: [Huh?]

Cecilus, hunched over ready for an immediate attack, tilted his head.

Despite the tacit understanding and the attitude of giving up the first move, the attack that was supposed to come didn't arrive.

Emilia had the same doubts as Cecilus. Emilia, who had been pushed to the edge before she knew it, knew that this was the final line that would determine the winner.

And yet, Mezoreia did not move. On the contrary――,

Mezoreia: [――――]

Immediately before this, Mezoreia had tried to swing its dragon arm to obliterate Cecilus. It stopped moving in mid-air, and its white eyes, the black parts of which could not be identified, stared at a point.

Not at Cecilus――who tried to push it into a corner and humiliate it.

It was not fixated on Cecilus, poised on the ice wall, nor was it staring at Emilia, who was cradling Madelyn and had turned this battlefield white, becoming a presence that Mezoreia could not ignore.

Mezoreia, still as if it had been struck dead, raised its gaze even higher into the sky.

It stopped and is gazing towards a point in the sky much, much higher than my own.

Emilia: [...Is something flying?]

Emilia followed Mezoreia's gaze and focused on the ashen, snow-laden clouds.

Even higher in the sky than where Mezoreia's huge body floated, there was a shadow of something flying just barely visible to Emilia's eyesight.

The only options Emilia could consider flying in the sky were the dragon in front of her, the flying dragons that flew in numbers across the battlefield, or Roswaal, who had been sidetracked by travel time.

And――,

Mezoreia: [――Unbelievable!]

Mezoreia flapped her wings as she muttered this.

The body of the dragon, which had stopped, resumed its movement. However, it was not a move to unleash a decisive attack like the one just before,

Cecilus: [Whaaa!? Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, what are you doing!?]

As soon as Cecilus saw its movement, his expression trembled with the greatest shock.

Until then, his expression seemed to be happy regardless of what was done to him. Now, his eyes grew wide in a great panic.

Mezoreia: [――――]

Not heeding Cecilus’ voice, Mezoreia flapped her wings and tore through the sky.

Once the dragon decided to fly and started moving, its speed was extraordinary and its momentum as it turned back and rose into the sky was as agile as an arrow shot with full force.

Cecilus: [Think I’ll let you do that!!]

In order to prevent the flying dragon from escaping, Cecilus bent his knees and exploded his legs to chase the flying dragon instead of intercepting it.

The small body made an incredible thrust, causing the thick, huge ice wall to crack from the sole of his shoe, and Cecilus' body leapt, shattering the ice like a collapsing cliff.

In a straight line, Cecilus' figure surpassed the dragon's speed and approached its wings. He drew nearer. Nearer, nearer, nearer, and――,

Cecilus: [――Ah, damn, I can't reach it, can I?]

No matter how fast Cecilus was on his feet and how far he could leap, he could not erase the distance to the dragon which was already in the sky.

Alas, Cecilus' body could not keep up with Mezoreia's as it moved away, and at the limit of his leap, he lost momentum and flipped upside down. If the "Cloud Dragon" had flipped its aim and gone for Cecilus, even he might have been in danger.

But Mezoreia did not return. It did not return; rather, it rose swiftly and ripped through the sky.

And――,

Cecilus: [――It’s going into the Imperial Capital?]

――Changes had taken place in multiple places in the siege of the Imperial Capital, but amongst them were the developments that had occurred in two places of particular importance.

At the same time, these had transpired in the exterior of the Crystal Palace, within the throne room, two Emperors met face-to-face, their gazes so close together that their eyelashes could have touched those of the other.

Abel: [――――]

The rebel ringleader, Abel, was dealt a move ahead; however, he switched gears on the spot.

He leaned forwards as to play his best move―― or rather, to play the next best move he had, against the person donning a visage identical to his own, who had approached his immediate front before his eyes.

Abel: [――Hk!]

A sharp strike was delivered to his left clavicle, his thoughts soldering red from the severe blow.

Taking a look, he saw that what had struck the base of his neck was being held by hand of the person right before him, an iron fan―― the preferred weapon of the person wearing the same visage as his own, an object he knew from sight.

Handling that weapon took something special, and he had harbored doubts of just how powerful a thing it was, many times in the past.

Abel: [――――]

The fact that he had attained the answer to his past questions, the pain penetrating his brain, he consciously excised them from his thoughts.

Envision within your mind the priorities of the now, and devise measures to address them, immediately. Picture in your mind the priorities of the present moment and immediately formulate measures to address them. Taking into consideration a combination of feasibility and effectiveness, alongside your injuries, arrange the priorities.

But――.

Vincent: [This is not a board game. This is why you are not worthy of being a warrior, it feeeels.] [1]

Faster than Abel was able to choose from the myriad of options that had emerged within his head, the warrior displayed the techniques that had permeated his body, his veins, rather than his head.

MerciIessly twisting Abel’s arm, he snatched away his own from the now-powerless limb; and in the moment following that, Abel’s vision was covered in dark for an instant.

Abel: [――――]

Has he crushed my eyes, or have my eyes been blinded in some way?

A moment's pondering, negated by the fact that his blocked vision returned immediately afterwards. If so, what had been the true meaning behind the other party's actions? And coincident with those thought, he realized.

――That once more, his own face was dressed in a familiar feeling.

Abel: [You――]

And thus his lips, moving faster than his hands or feet, let out a sound as he glared into the black eyes before him.

With those words from Abel, on whom he had put the oni mask which he snatched away, the false Emperor before him―― No, Chisha Gold, twisted his lips, the lips on a face that was not his own.

Recognizing that upon his own face was a dreadfully decadent smile, Abel’s eyes widened.

A moment later――,

Abel: [――――]

――A white light came rushing in, piercing a wall of the throne room, and perfurated the chest of the one at the apex of the Empire, Vincent Vollachia, from behind.

Translation notes:

[1] Vincent’s speech style here changes somewhat dramatically, switching the way he refers to Abel via a second-person pronoun, from the usual Emperor-ly “貴様” to a more casual (or even disrespectful, considering the context) “あなた”, among other changes. This perhaps serves to indicate that he’s dropping the facade right now, and acting as Chisha Gold rather than a fake of Vincent Vollachia.
