*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――In the battlefields that colored the battle for the Imperial Capital, two places stood out as scenes that showed off a particular color.

One is the second bastion, where the Cloud Dragon that came from beyond the sky spread its wings majestically and painted everything white to protect itself from the spread of damage around it.

The other is the first bastion, where the burning sun-drenched sky ――the power of a young woman at the center of it all has made the environment so harsh that the survival of any living creature is threatened.

???: [――――]

Shimmering like a flicker of flame, Arakiya dances its body into the red sky.

The world transformed by Arakiya, The Spirit Eater, was already an inferno that consumed the lives of those who lacked power beyond the realm of the rational.

Arakiya: [I will take the princess――]

――I will definitely take her back.

That is the first and only reason why Arakiya is engaged on the battlefield thus.

There is no sense of loyalty or patriotism as a general of the empire, no pride or pride in being one of the strongest Nine Divine Generals, no anger as a species, no sense of personal merit, or any other malicious thoughts.

The other Nine Divine Generals have their own motivations and reasons for fighting.

Even without any lofty foundation to support such strength, Arakiya, the Second, reigned supreme among the forces possessed by the Imperial City side.

However, this is only natural considering her origin ――the fact that she is a Spirit Eater.

Being a Spirit Eater is to be strong and to use that strength not for oneself but for others, and Arakiya is no exception to this rule.

To begin with, a Spirit Eater is an extraordinary creature that can only be as such.

Spirits are present everywhere throughout the earth and in every sky.

A Spirit Eater ――one who feeds upon Spirits, takes in their power, and becomes one with them is as outlandish as incorporating nature into one's own body, and inevitably, there are many effects, both large and small.

If one took in a Fire Spirit, one's body temperature would rise, and if one took in a Wind Spirit, there was a danger that one's inner body would be torn apart. If a Water Spirit was taken in, it could jeopardize the circulation of blood, and if an Earth Spirit was taken in, it was possible that the person would become one with the earth and even lose their human body.

In fact, many aspiring Spirit Eaters have ceased to be human because of these ill effects.

Created in ancient times to oppose a lone Witch who charmed all things, even the mute Great Spirit, they are beings meant to fight, similar to the Oni tribe that can sense Miasma.

Spirit Eaters lost their original purpose after the death of the Witch, but a faction within the Vollachian Empire, seeing the power and utility they offered, planned to revive them.

Arakiya was just an example of one of the rare talents recognized in that endeavor.

There are two rare qualities required for a Spirit Eater ――A body that can withstand a Spirit and a mind that can remain human even after the Spirit has been absorbed.

To begin with, the method by which the "Spirit Eater" draws power from Spirit is an external method, and the method of extracting only its power, bypassing various preconditions, entails great risks. That is the main difference between Spiritual Arts Users who borrow the power of the Spirit and the Acolyte Knights of the Holy Kingdom of Gusteko, who gain their power by enslaving Spirits.

The former also requires some effort to establish a connection with the target Spirit, but once a contract is established, there is no danger in using their power as long as the relationship with the Spirit is not disrupted.

On the other hand, a Spirit Eater who must constantly replenish their Spirits in order to maintain their strength, is frightened by the possibility of losing their physical and mental selves with each replenishment.

Once the body and mind are overwhelmed by the Spirit that they take in, the body loses its original state, and the mind is assimilated by the Spirit and is dragged into a non-human dimension.

On the other hand, an overly strong ego greatly hinders one's affinity with a Spirit, making it impossible to achieve the full potential of a Spirit Eater in the first place.

Therefore, "a Spirit Eater" is required to have an almost diluted self-consciousness and ego in order to be in harmony with the power of the Spirit they have taken in. However, as mentioned above, an ego that is too weak can easily lead to assimilation and loss of one's identity as a person.

To prevent this from happening, a Spirit Eater provides a foundation ――a "core" to keep them from losing sight of themselves, in place of a weak ego or self-consciousness.

Thus, the core functions like the imprinting of a newly hatched chick that thinks the first person it sees is the parent bird, and is deeply rooted in the instincts of a Spirit Eater and forms its foundation.

The immense power of a Spirit Eater is exerted toward its core, and the naïve mind of a Spirit Eater is consumed by its core.

Precisely, the core is the meaning of being a Spirit Eater.

――A Spirit Eater is someone who has selflessly pledged his service to its core, with no ambition to betray it.

After countless depressing sacrifices, the Spirit Eaters were resurrected from an ancient age to the present day. Even those in the empire could not believe that this success was worth the number of lives that had been sacrificed.

Therefore, the girl who became the only example of perfection was presented to the emperor of the time, Drizen Vollachia, as a being with valuable abilities, and Drizen gave it to one of his own blood daughters as a foster sister.

We do not know what Emperor Drizen Vollachia thought of the offered child, or for what reason he bestowed it on his own daughter.

If there is one thing that can be said about the girl, it is that she has done exactly what that faction wanted in order to revive the power of "The Spirit Eater" and that they have made Drizen's daughter their core of strength.

And above all――,

 ――As a Spirit Eater, Arakiya was more formidable and powerful than any of her predecessors who had been called upon to fight against the Witch.

After the world began to overheat in a way that made a mockery of common sense, just breathing burned the lungs, the tubes in which the body’s blood flowed swelled due to the heat, and even the teardrops to moisten, parched eyes evaporated.

In an environment where life was being eaten away moment by moment, one could not halfheartedly even get close enough to check the color of Arakiya's eyes. No matter the kind of life, it would be left behind, thirsting, withering away, and dying, unable to keep up with the altered world.

For that reason, except for Arakiya, who was the center of the alteration to the world, on that vast land overlooked by a red sky, only two people stood, Yorna and Priscilla.

Even Yorna and Priscilla could not escape the feeling that their lives were being slowly eaten away.

Yorna: [――Hk.]

Yorna's cheeks stiffened at the sense of loss after her fourth hairpin made a noise as it was destroyed.

The "Soul Marriage" technique allowed the many offerings made to Yorna to stand in for her life. Thanks to this, Yorna was not physically injured, and her movements were unhindered, even when fighting the literally monstrous Arakiya.

However――, 

Yorna: [If only I could get rid of this pain in my chest.]

Standing in for Yorna's life was in and of itself proof of the love that had been put into these gifts.

The hairpins were by no means outstandingly designed or expensive. They were merely various things that had been offered by the residents of the city under Yorna's protection, using their own horns, scales, and body parts.

There was only love, respect and trust. Therefore, no price could be put on it.

Priscilla: [The hairpin shattered? With the hair ornament a moment ago, they are slowly being whittled away, Dear Mother.]

As the shattered pieces of the plain ornament slipped between the crevices of Yorna’s fingers, Priscilla landed next to her, the hem of her red dress fluttering.

Wielding the dizzyingly radiant Yang Sword, Priscilla wore a fearless expression on her beautiful face.

Yorna: [I should say now, to treat the gifts of my beloved children as a mere substitute for what remains of my life is not something that I am happy to do.]

Priscilla: [Dear Mother, you, who has changed lives many times, and lived for so long, still say such cute things. Would you hesitate to call me, who has never given you a single gift, your beloved child?]

Yorna: [————]

Priscilla: [You aren’t even capable of playing along? ——Then I shall speak pragmatically, just as you wish.]

Shrugging her exposed pale shoulders, Priscilla turned her gaze forwards. To this attitude and tone, Yorna repeated the words “Pragmatically?” back at her.

In response to this, Priscilla pulled her chin inwards slightly.

Priscilla: [How much longer can we fight with that thing, I wonder.]

Priscilla turned her crimson eyes up towards the sky. ——And immediately after, a torrent of water spears rained down, aimed at Priscilla and Yorna, who were on the ground.

Yorna: [——Hk!]

Gritting her teeth, Yorna began ducking under the fierce downpour of water spears.

The fired water spears had each been compressed to be as thick as a single finger; however, one should not underestimate what a single finger could possess.

The densely compressed torrent, which mercilessly drilled through all which stood in its way, indiscriminately cutting through anything that lived, could tear someone limb from limb and deal them a fatal blow.

To think of splitting the ground by using such a crude amount of water, and then wielding such a difficult and precise technique freely. Except for the danger that was posed, none of it seemed consistent.

Yorna: [——Hk, Priscilla!]

Ducking down and pouring all of her efforts into evading the downpour of water spears, Yorna called out the name of Priscilla, who was using the Yang Sword to clear away the torrent of water.

Brandishing this radiant, treasured sword, Priscilla successively cut through the torrent of water. Despite the number of water spears aimed at her being double what Yorna had to deal with, it was completely ineffectual.

Between Yorna and Priscilla, it was easy to guess which one Arakiya attached more importance to based on the sheer volume of water.

Yorna: [————]

The dance of the crimson blade through that air, the fluttering of Priscilla’s swordsmanship, it was difficult not to be entranced by their elegance.

However, it was not possible to say that this was able to fully hold off Arakiya’s assault. 

Just like how she had alluded to the remaining ornaments on Yorna’s body a moment ago, Priscilla had also had much of the jewelry that adorned her beauty shattered over the course of the battle.

The time limit which bound Yorna was not just limited to her.

Priscilla: [Even if you blow off my limbs, yes? ――A fascinating, macabre hope, is it not?.]

As Priscilla received a piercing attack in her ample breasts, the jewel of her necklace exploded.

Priscilla's crimson eyes turn only to the figure of Arakiya in the sky, ignoring the fate of the jewel that took the place of her life.

However, seeing Priscilla's profile looking at Arakiya, Yorna couldn't believe her eyes. For a moment, it was hard to believe what was wrong with those crimson eyes.

It was――,

Yorna: [Do you regret, Priscilla, the way Arakiya is?]

Priscilla: [Nonsense. ――Everything in this world is made for my convenience.]

Priscilla snorted at Yorna's question and leaned forward to run.

The way she rushed to her embittered foster sibling, leaving her mother behind, seems to hide her feelings for both of them in order not to look into their eyes.

Yorna: [I am also regretful for what I have done.]

Yorna does not know what kind of encounters and partings there were between Priscilla and Arakiya.

She was in a position to know, but the opportunity to know was snatched away with her life.  Yorna's predecessor lost her life in a difficult childbirth delivering Priscilla.

Afterward, the Imperial Selection Ceremony took place, and the daughter of Vollachia's royal family ――Prisca Benedict, was also defeated in battle and lost her life.

That should have been the life known by the daughter of Yorna's predecessor, Sandra Benedict.

But――

Yorna: [――――]

For some reason, time passed, and circumstances unfolded in such an implausible way that Yorna and Priscilla were reunited.

They are reunited not as Sandra and Prisca, but as Yorna and Priscilla, and through a miracle that originally should never have been possible, mother and child go through the red hell together.

――Yes, they will go together.

Arakiya: [Princess.]

Muttering these words briefly, Arakiya's entire body literally erupts in a flood of power.

Whether it is fire or water, wind or earth, light or shadow, the being of infinite transformations that uses the entire composition of the world poured all of her energy toward Priscilla, who is approaching her.

Priscilla, in turn, rushes forward as if to show that she will take it on herself with her sword; as streams of water and lightning rush toward her, she is met with the sound of a thunderous roar――,

Yorna: [――I Love you.]

A moment later, Priscilla's Yang Sword was aimed overhead, and the two directly colliding attacks of water and lightning disappeared. ――No, they did not disappear like smoke.

Undoubtedly, they were cut away by the slash of the Yang Sword.

However, the sword flash drawn by the red treasure sword was even more refined and blindingly fast than before.

Priscilla: [This is…]

With a slight, surprised exhalation in her voice, Priscilla's well-shaped brow furrowed.

The winds of reddish flame approached her from all directions. But Priscilla did not hesitate to slash away the scorching wind with a slash, easily cleaving them away.

 Then, as if to confirm, Priscilla's hand gently touched her face. Her fingertips gently caressed her eyes, but she would not have been able to sense anything unusual.

Yorna already knows. that it is different from an actual flame with physical effects.

――The flame of the bond that burns in the eyes of Yorna, which is shaped by her love for her beloved child, is the flame of the bond.

Priscilla: [――――]

Priscilla stood straight, red treasure sword in hand, her left eye alight with flame.

It is proof of Yorna's protection given to the inhabitants of the Demon City of Chaosflame. By granting the Soul Marriage Technique, a portion of Yorna's power is shared with the object intended to be protected.

Originally, it was a secret technique bestowed by Yorna to her children who did not have the strength and technique to fight and protect themselves, and there existed a bond that could not be granted to any warrior.

But here is where an exception to that rule arises.

Equipped with the power to fight and the technique, she holds in her hand her treasured sword that no one but the royal family of Vollachia is allowed to wield, meeting the requirements to be a beloved child that Yorna wishes to protect, regardless of her power.

Yorna: [Priscilla――]

Priscilla: [At last, you are willing to recognize mineself as your own child, dear mother.]

Yorna: [Impudent. ――I can't be a foolish mother who just looks away as her back wanders. If the Lord is going, I will go to the same hell.]

Priscilla alone, wouldn’t have been able to go beyond that point.

 Priscilla sniffed at Yorna's answer and allowed Yorna to prepare herself to stand next to her. To prove it, Yorna felt something strange on her face and gently moved her hand to cover it.

The cause was probably the flame in her eyes, the same as Priscilla's.

The two users of the Soul Marriage Technique, which cannot be performed without qualifications, fulfilled each other's conditions and complemented each other's souls.

And then, having witnessed that,

Arakiya: [...Why]

 A faint voice escaped, and a cursed gaze fell to the ground.

 Staring at Yorna and Priscilla side by side had been Arakiya, who placed herself in the sky. She ran her hand over her face and the eye patch covering her left eye.

 Then, as if plucking it off, she had ripped it off.

Arakiya: [Why! Why, why, why, you are the princess!]

Showing her anger, Arakiya displayed a red eye bereft of all light under her eyepatch. Yorna was reflected in that hidden eye, and Arakiya called out to her with a pair of red eyes.

To Yorna, whose eye held a flame, and receives the benefits of the "Soul Marriage Technique" from Priscilla.

Arakiya, whose eyes held no flame, could receive no blessing from Priscilla.

Arakiya: [The Princess is my…]

Priscilla: [Make no mistake, Arakiya. Even if your wishes were to be accepted, and even if I were to concede, you would still be mine, and I would never be yours.]

Arakiya: [――hk]

Priscilla: [And I would never concede to anyone.]

At Priscilla's decisive gaze, Arakiya gasped slightly.

However, that fierce declaration by Priscilla had been interrupted by a small sound of protest.

That was――,

Priscilla: [Dear Mother, for what reason did you strike mineself on the head?]

Yorna: [You should not speak in such a manner. I don't remember raising my child to be so high and mighty.]

Priscilla: [Dear Mother, I don't remember being raised by you in the first place.]

Yorna: [In that case, it seems that chance has finally come around.]

Saying that, Yorna lowered the kiseru that had struck Priscilla's head, and slowly shook her head before looking up at Arakiya.

In her eyes, there was that unchanging anger, and a slight agitation at what had just occurred.

Staring fixedly there, in hell, Yorna put the kiseru in her mouth and inhaled the purple smoke.

And then, somewhat cheerfully, with a smile that did not fit the situation,

Yorna: [Finally, you have seen me, General First-Class Arakiya. ――The chance has come for me to atone for my immorality in failing to discipline you, together with Priscilla, as I should have.]

Arakiya: [What do you…]

Priscilla: [Put simply――]

Yorna exhaled purple smoke as she took in the confusion that was carried in those words.

Wrapped in the smoke overflowing from her lips, her eye burning with her daughter’s trust, Yorna Mishigure, the mother that was once Sandra Benedict,

Yorna: [――I am not a parent that cuts corners in disciplining their children. Prepare yourselves, little girls.]

Thus she had harshly declared.
