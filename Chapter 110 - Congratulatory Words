*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

Biting into the ground hard with their bestial claws, they launch their body forward with such force that they seem to pull the ground out of their path.

Their companions, using their wits and martial prowess, are scrambling to take control of the battlefield. Frederica Baumann races across the battlefield to help them.

The beautiful golden-haired leopard sailed through the wind and continued fulfilling her role as messenger, the second fastest among all those roaming around the battlefield.

Against the overwhelmingly superior quality of the Imperial regulars, the rebels, who were, to put it bluntly, a patchwork of people, were able to bring the situation to a stalemate thanks to the information gathered by Otto Suwen, Abel's management of that information, and Frederica's ability to quickly transmit it.

Regardless of whether Frederica was aware of her contribution or not, she was kicking up dirt with important information at this time, and the impact of that information was particularly significant.

It was――,

Frederica: [――A message from the Master and my brother, that there are signs of a change within the earth.]

Breathing hard, pushing her exhausted beastified body, Frederica, hurriedly announces her arrival at the main camp, where she is willing to expose her bare skin.

These were the words of Garfiel, who had survived a fierce battle while traveling across the battlefield, communicated to Frederica in a passionate expression, not proud of the outcome of the battle.

Ragged and bloody, Garfiel survived the unimaginable death struggle as Frederica, and her sisterly admiration for her brother's struggle was postponed in the face of his desperate plea.

Fortunately, Roswaal, arriving with reinforcements from the flying dragon squadron, is by Garfiel's side and will be able to assist him appropriately. Regardless of Garfiel's feelings about being so by his love rival.

???: [――. That wasn’t very specific. Any more details?]

Frederica: [I do not know, I can only say that it was a gut feeling from my brother's Divine Protection. It is just…"

???: [Just?]

Frederica: [My brother's hunches are often both good and bad.]

Garfiel's instincts are as good as a wild animal's, even though he has never been out in the wild. Garfiel's instincts do not work well in everyday life, and he frequently exposes his ugly behavior in front of Ram, but when it comes to fighting, his reliability is unparalleled.

That is why Frederica, without any hesitation, rushed to the main camp.

???: [――――]

Hearing Frederica's plea, the beautiful Serena Dracroy ――a High Countess of the Empire who had come to their side with her flying dragon squadron reinforcements, looked thoughtful.

She was an acquaintance of Roswaal's that he went to ask for help from, and since she was Roswaal's acquaintance, she was probably a woman of strong character. However, this is also a common characteristic of Roswaal's acquaintances, and aside from her personality, there is no doubt that she is excellent in terms of her abilities.

This is evident in the fact that she is currently serving as acting commander-in-chief at the main camp, where the movement of the rebels, now a large army, is being controlled.

???: [Frederica-sama! Here is a cloak to wear!]

A red cloak was draped over Frederica's shoulders from behind as she looked thoughtfully at Serena's profile, a cloak that only Generals of the Vollachian Empire were allowed to wear, but the person who did so, awe-struck, was not familiar with the meaning of adornment. 

Because of this, Frederica smiled, happy for the pure goodwill.

Frederica: [Thank you, Schult-sama. I apologize for my unseemly appearance.]

Schult: [No, not at all! Frederica-sama has worked hard and ran around amongst so many people! I think it's very admirable!]

Pulling the cloak tighter around her, Frederica thanked Schult for his hospitality, but it was Schult who was the one who was bowing before Frederica, his small body filled with charm.

Schult's feelings of being left behind in the main camp and having to watch the progress of the battle with a sense of dread must be even more painful than Frederica's, who was able to fulfill the role of a messenger.

Still, it is admirable that Frederica is given praise upon her return.

???: [Yeah, Freh is great too, Uu wanted to go fight like crazy with Mii and the others.]

Next to Schult is Utakata, whose black hair is dyed pink at the ends, nodding with her arms crossed.

Flinching at the little girl's warlike comment, Frederica turned her attention back to Serena.

Serena stroked the large white sword scar on the left side of her face,

Serena: [Signs of trouble within the land of Vollachia, yes? How foolish it would be to disregard the words of the one whom Roswaal values so highly.]

Frederica: [So…]

Serena: [I have my resentment, but it also fits with what the Stargazer said, as he disappeared. It was a selfish thing to say, to entrust me with a great task that only I could fulfill. It was as if…]

Frederica: [As if?]

Serena: [It was Pride as if he was the Emperor himself. And yet, I was in a position to come and avenge him.]

Serena, arms crossed, sighs with a complicated expression that is neither anger nor bemusement.

She spoke of the man in the Oni mask ――Abel. Originally in charge of the overall command of the rebels, however, he left the main camp and entrusted that role to Serena.

Though Serena has not given any details on what kind of talk took place at that time.

Frederica: [Before he left here, what did Abel-sama say to you, Serena-sama?]

Serena: [――. The conclusion is near. However.]

Serena paused, her almond-shaped eyes now filled with indignation. The "Scorching Lady," known for her fiery bearing, continued, her well-shaped chin indicating the battlefield, her eyes glowing with resentment.

Frederica: [The resolution will not be decided by either side, the Imperial Capital or the rebels, and it will be inconclusive.]

Frederica: [It will be… inconclusive?]

Serena's expression suggests that she would not even be able to say it, which perplexes Frederica.

What kind of situation can be expected when a battle of this magnitude takes place, and the outcome is left inconclusive? In the first place, it would be inappropriate to use words that could be taken to mean that all efforts will be in vain when addressing the person whom he has entrusted with the command of the battlefield.

Abel, leaving it unsaid, fatally does not understand the human heart; it must be said.

In any case――,

Schult: [Does this mean that the battle has been concluded? If so, does that mean that Priscilla-sama, Al-sama, and Heinkel-sama will return?]

Frederica: [Schult-sama…]

With melancholy in his round eyes, Schult stretches out with his small body and looks out over the battlefield.

The boy's eyes were drawn to a corner of the increasingly harsh battlefield ――the red sky, the white sky, two battlefields that even Frederica was unable to traverse.

The mere approach instilled a feeling of dread in her beastly instincts, a certainty that her body would not be able to hold out.

Frederica: [――――]

For that reason, Frederica does not feel able to readily speak words of comfort.

What was happening in that space was surely a phenomenon that transcended Frederica's imagination. Frederica felt ashamed and lowered the corners of her eyes.

Utakata: [Shuu, don't worry. Puu and Yor are both strong. They're as strong as Mii and Taa.]

Schult: [Utakata-sama…]

Utakata: [Uu-chan is fine.]

Schult: [Utakata-chan-sama…]

Puffing out her chest, Utakata roughly strokes Schult's pink curly-haired head with her hand.

It was a childish and baseless assertion, but it resonated with Schult because there was no hesitation. Frederica's lips parted slightly at Schult's nodding head.

Then again, she turned to Serena.

Frederica: [What are you going to do, Serena-sama? If you choose not to abandon my brother's intuition, then you need to deal with what Abel-sama said…]

Serena: [I'm in a quandary. Needless to say, there is no time for hesitation. ――Look.]

Serena again cocked her chin, and Frederica responded with a "huh?] and is directed to look toward the battlefield. In her emerald green eyes, Frederica sees, even from afar, a change in the battlefield ――a rampaging giant humanoid wall; one of the Nine Divine Generals turns his back and rushes toward the Imperial Capital.

Frederica: [Is that… headed to the Crystal Palace?]

Serena: [More and more, that man is right. ――I don't know the veracity of your brother's statement that Vollachia will become the enemy.]

Serena frowned with a familiar look on her face at The Steelman Moguro Hagane's violent outburst.

And then――,

Serena: [Tell everyone. ――As soon as there is anything abnormal at the Crystal Palace, cease all the fighting. Prepare for this inconclusive battle, for the blood that has been shed, for the lives that have been spilled over for nothing.]

△▼△▼△▼△

――With a shrill sound, the Blue Dragon Sword, axe, and barbarian sword struck each other in mid-air, sending off sparks.

It was steel that was wielded mercilessly to take the life of their opponent.

I had been becoming numb, but now that it was directed at me once again, the dread of my life being threatened surged within my skin and bones.

I never thought of myself as mentally fragile. Rather, I have always thought that, compared to other children my age, I was blessed with more courage, combined with the experiencing scenes of carnage that I have survived.

However, if one experienced the sizzling pain on their skin from being scorched by a blast, and a breathless feeling as if their lungs have contracted under the pressure, the foundation of that trust in themselves was likely to waver.

The most important reason for that is――,

???: [――Hk!]

Even in the midst of battle, a contemptuous gaze was directed toward them.

The man's gaze, as if he had not forgotten about her and was holding a knife to her, was the biggest factor that increased Petra's suffocating feeling.

He was an imperial soldier with a bandana wrapped around his head, wielding an axe.

This person, whose name they did not know, was the true character of the difficult enemy that was currently tormenting Petra and her comrades.

As long as you live, death is always adjacent to you.

Regardless of the situation, circumstances could change in the blink of an eye. Petra strongly gritted her teeth as the man in front of her seemed to be an example of that absurdity.

Kneeling on the ground, Otto labored to breath. Having taken the brunt of the blast from the magic stone used for the emergency evacuation, Otto was heavy with fatigue.

That was why Petra could never afford to be weak on the battlefield, where both the strong and the weak alike put their lives on the line.

Medium: [Haaah! Al-chin!]

Al: [Yeah, Lil’ Miss Medium.]

The one with the high-pitched voice, unsuitable for the blood-scented battlefield, and the one with the dispirited voice worked together while exchanging swords with the one with the pitch-black murderous intent.

Cooperating with Medium, who used her small body to the fullest, Al fought with the Imperial soldier. Their combat power was not enough to overwhelm their enemy, and the fierce fight co
Due to Al himself, Petra was disappointed with him as a reinforcement.

Petra: [If it were someone like Garf-san or Emily…]

Not only were they simply reliable allies, but they would surely have overwhelmed their opponent in terms of ability.

Al's ability to do so was not very high in Petra's view. Even though he was better than non-combatants like Petra and Otto, she felt that he was weaker than any of the Shudraq.

However, in the sense that his strength was not that outstanding, the same was true of the opposing Imperial soldier.

Surely that imperial Soldier was weak compared to Emilia, Garfiel, and the Nine Divine Generals of the Empire. Still, Petra was terrified of him.

Overwhelming magic isn’t needed to shoo away a bug. It could be brushed off with a finger or a little water. Such thoughts were apparent in the attitude of this Imperial Soldier.

On this battlefield, Petra and the rest of her group were nothing more than hard-working little bugs――.

Soldier: [――You're a pain in the ass, man.]

Suddenly, a man's voice slipped into Petra's cowering ears.

For a moment, here shoulders jumped, but it was not Petra’s group who called out, rather it came from the direction where Al was engaged in a sword fight with his opponent.

Al: [Hah! Nuo! Take this!]

The man swung an axe in his hand, aiming it at Al's thick neck. However, when it was struck by his one-armed Blue Dragon Sword, he immediately turned himself around and two, then three heavy attacks landed in quick succession.

Al managed to parry the barrage of blows with a bizarrely dangerous hand.

Petra was not at all at ease, and she even let out a couple of little screams of “kyah!” and “yikes!” as she watched.

Otto: [I would like to support Al-san somehow, but…]

Otto seemed to have the same anxiety, and there was more impatience than fatigue in his voice.

There was clearly a sense of urgency in Al's noisy battle, and although he was fortunate to be able to survive until now, there were five times where one wrong step could have resulted in his death.

Whether there would be a sixth time seemed to be a bad bet to Petra.

Soldier: [You’re still a pain in the ass.]

However, it seemed that the opinion of the Imperial Soldier was slightly different from that of Petra and her comrades.

The man, who continued to shrug off the attacks, even though it was dangerous, took a large step backward, whereupon he raised his axe-less hand and waved it lightly in the direction of Al and Medium.

Immediately after, a fireball was born in the air, and it ran furiously toward them, burning the sky.

Al: [Hey hey hey hey!]

Medium: [Ukya―!]

She does not understand why, but the Spirit is being forced to obey in an unjust way.

Al and Medium held their heads and ran to escape the fireball that was approaching. The fireball missed them and spread to the surrounding trees and grass on the ground, which caused the flames to swell.

Otto: [This is bad…hk]

Petra understood Otto’s muttering.

If you look, the flames brought by the fireball didn't burn Al and the others, but instead burned the surroundings, which surrounded Petra and the others who were facing the Imperial soldier, blocking their escape route.

The blazing flames created a circle and trapped them there.

Even if he missed, the Imperial soldier may have been aiming to block their escape route, but that situation had Petra and the others grinding their teeth in frustration, and their opponent tilted his head.

Soldier: [I don’t like this.]

"Huh?" Al yelled at that quiet, totally inappropriate remark.

With his blue dragon sword in his hand, he pointed to the blazing surroundings,

Al: [After all this, what are you saying? Cherish what you have, your resources. How hard do you think plants have to work to get oxygen so that humans can take a deep breath and be okay…]

Soldier: [I should have killed you about six times so far, but I haven't been able to kill you once. Even if I throw you in a place where you can't dodge. Disgusting.]

Al: [I can’t believe I was told that. Man, today is a real pain.]

Al’s response is met by the man shrugging and growing more distrustful of him.

Not knowing the bottom of Al's strength, the Imperial soldier seemed to be quite confused. To be honest, it is very disgusting to agree with that person, but Petra had the same doubts about Al.

Al looked like he was going to die, but he still didn’t.

He responded to the attacks of the Imperial soldier, but managed to avoid fatal wounds with his dangerous movements. ――He surely avoided only fatal wounds.

But it's not like he's hiding his ability, this is very irregular.

That's why the Imperial soldier also can't get a decisive blow to cut his losses.

Soldier: [Even if you put him in the same category as me, I get the feeling you have no training at all and are just winging this. In that sense, that guy back there is probably more in my class.}

Otto: [...Do you mean me? If so, I would like to raise an objection on my honor.]

Medium: [That's right! Your evil character is different! You're more dangerous and sneaky!]

Otto: [Even though you're on my side, you're still backstabbing me.]

Otto, unexpectedly pulled into the topic, chuckled bitterly.

Otto's demeanor made Petra a little frustrated, but that quickly faded.

Petra: [...]

Otto glanced and winked at Petra. She thought about it, sensing something other than bitterness in his expression, something he was planning to do.

Without saying a word, he wanted Petra to guess.

Soldier: [This is taking too long.]

Just after Petra guessed this, the Imperial soldier, with a cold voice, snapped his fingers.

Right after that, about 10 fireballs, smaller than before, were born all at once, and they scattered in all directions at unreadable speed, which ignited not Petra and the others, but the surrounding trees and ground.

He did that to expand the flame formation surrounding them, and the accompanying flames and black smoke――,

Medium: [Hot hot hot hot! It’s burning, it’s burning!]

Al: [Calm down, Lil’ Miss! Come here before your braids burn!]

Surrounded by flames, a fiery Medium jumped up and down, holding her long braids. She crossed the line of flames, jumped to Al's side, and looked back at him with tears in her eyes.

Gripping her barbarian sword tightly again, she glared at the person who had done this to her――,

Medium: [Huh!?]

Al: [Really…?]

Medium's surprise is matched by Al's exasperation.

The cause of their reaction, the disappearance of the Imperial soldier who created this spectacle of flames.

Medium: [――――]

The figure of the Imperial soldier vanished amidst the flames and black smoke. Did he flee to hide from the flames, or was he waiting for them to slowly burn to death?

Al: [Tsk…]

Medium: [They are totally gone! We have to get out of here before we burn too!]

Al's helmet-covered vision swept around, searching for the figure of the man who had disappeared into the flames. All the while, he held his own blue dragon sword against his own neck, his eyes fixed on the Imperial soldier in a strange stance.

Beside him, Medium also looks around a bit, impatient with the enemy she cannot find, and pleads to avoid the growing fire.

To be sure, it is only natural for one to think that the priority here should be to get away from the dangerous area, and not to lose sight of escaping by obsessing over the man's whereabouts.

However――,

Petra: [――――]

Otto's hand was placed on Petra's hand, propping her up, holding her tightly, while Otto put a little more pressure in his hand. Petra took the tight grip as a silent instruction.

Petra strongly supported that caution, indicating that they should not let their guard down.

Then Petra put her other hand on top of Otto's hand――,

Otto: [――Thank you, Petra-chan.]

Immediately after uttering these words of gratitude, Otto shifted in place and fell down onto his back. ――A moment later, the axe narrowly missed, cleaving horizontally.

Petra: [――――]

The killing intent of the Imperial soldier approaching through the smoke from the spreading flames struck out.

The man, emptied of the certainty of the moment, looked at the fact lightly. But, as if quickly regaining his composure, the man tried to pull back the axe he had swung――

Petra: [Jiwald!]

Soldier: [Guh.]

Petra, holding up five fingers, released from all of them, a low-power Jiwald catching the Imperial soldier radially in the face, and one of the five shots seared the opponent's right eye.

Petra's attack was aimed to suppress the enemy by sacrificing power. It successfully achieved its goal, and the man who had his eye burnt, cried out in agony and recoiled.

Then, a spinning figure leapt at him from the air.

Medium: [Let's gooo!]

Behind the flames, Al was hunched over, while Medium jumped off his back using it as a springboard.

Spinning vertically, Medium flashed the tightly gripped barbarian sword with both hands, and it struck the Imperial soldier who had lost his posture with no mercy.

Medium: [Uryaa!]

A hard sound echoed, and a different shade of red mixed together with the burning flames.

The sound that echoed was not the sound of a skull splitting under a barbarian sword. Petra looked as she raised her hand. Petra saw the man voluntarily meet the swinging sword with his forehead.

That hard sound was probably from the armor he had placed under his bandana. That was how he got hit by Medium. Of course, they were not completely unscathed.

Swinging his axe awkwardly with his shaking free hand on his forehead, Down, down, down――,

Soldier: [Shit…]

A bandana stained with blood fell from the man's head. The man's forehead was cut open even with the armored bandana, but the bleeding from the split forehead could not be stopped.

The man glared at Otto and Petra, bleeding profusely.

The look in his eyes asks why his surprise attack was detected――,

Otto: [――I will not tell you. I am not your parent or brother.]

Even though Otto was lying on the ground, he still spoke up as if he were proud of his victory.

In response, the Imperial soldier clicked his tongue. They clicked their tongue, wiped the blood from their forehead with their palm, and,

Soldier: [Ah! Wait! It would all so unfair to run away!]

He did not choose to be reckless and jump on him.

With his right eye closed, occluded by heat and blood, the Imperial soldier disappeared behind the flames. Again invisible, Petra is on the lookout for another surprise attack.

Al: [He is not coming… He didn't seem desperate enough to continue to fight at a disadvantage.]

Petra: [Ummm, I disagree. Wasn’t it like we were the only ones who were desperate?]

Al: [I know how you feel, Lil’ Lady. But it's the other side that ran away without a last word. We win, we win. ――It's our wiiiiiiiin!]

Medium: [We wiiin!]

Al and Medium shout a victory cry as they head in the direction where the Imperial soldier disappeared.

Petra's heart was lightened a little by the two of them, although she was not sure if it would actually harass that Imperial soldier.

In any case――,

Petra: [In the end, how did you read that man’s moves? It was a gamble, wasn't it?]

Otto: [It was not thanks to me; it was thanks to you, Petra-chan.]

With the help of Al, with his now-sheathed blue dragon sword, Otto was guided by Petra. However, Petra cannot take credit for everything.

Otto: [In the first place, I was the target, so I knew that the last move was aimed at me. It was the sound of footsteps that told me the time and direction of the attack.]

Medium: [Footsteps?]

Petra: [Otto-san's channel, let us hear from the children under the ground… right?]

Otto: [That is the correct answer.]

Petra clasps her hands together in front of her chest at Otto's nod of the head.

Originally, Otto used his "Divine Protection of The Soul of Language" to maintain control of the entire battlefield, which was the reason why he was targeted by the enemy. Although it is not known how that Imperial soldier appeared, having avoided Otto's Divine Protection, which can hear animals and insects and grasp the whole picture.

To perceive such an opponent, the same method as before was not enough.

Petra: [So, that's why the children under the ground… they were useless ones as Otto-san said, they don't have eyes to see what's going on outside.]

Otto: [I just wish I had chosen my words a little more carefully! …Anyway, I listened for animals and insects in the ground and determined where they were by the sound of their footsteps. It was a bit hit and miss, but Petra-chan was able to help me pick up the voices with her yang magic.]

Petra: [Otto-san, you gave me a signal with an ugly look on your face.]

Otto asked Petra for support with yang magic when his hand was held tightly.

With his help, Otto used Divine Protection and guessed his opponent's position from the sound of his footsteps, avoiding the final ambush and, by contrast, inflicted a painful blow on their opponent and forcing him to retreat.

Otto: [――. To tell you the truth, I wanted to make them unable to fight.]

Petra: [I agree. He wasn't strong, he was just good at killing. More importantly…]

Medium: [Hot, hot, hot! We've got to get out of here fast, or we're going to get baked!]

Retreating from a dangerous enemy does not necessarily overcome the situation where the surrounding area is on fire.

Hearing Medium's complaint, Al lent his shoulder to Otto and said, "Yeah, you're right". Petra, along with Medium, will lead them, looking for a spot where the effects of the flames are less severe.

And so, the group attempts to leave before the flames engulf them――,

Otto: [Let's get out of here as soon as possible. There is now a reason to return to the main camp.]

Al: [...The way you put it, it doesn't sound like a prelude to bragging about the heroic story of how you survived a dangerous opponent.]

Otto: [Yes, it's bad news. Things are getting very time sensitive. …Earlier, I was trying to listen for footsteps, and this is just a secondary piece of information I heard.]

It is an unpleasant preface that is spoken just as one hardship is about to be over.

Chased by the heat of the flames, but still unable to miss the statement, Petra turned to see a grim-faced Otto behind her ――or, rather, looking out over the entire battlefield.

Otto: [It seems that the whole battlefield is about to be compromised from a completely different aspect: the dragon and the burning sky and all of that. In fact, it's right in front of our eyes.]

Coincidentally, at the same time that his brother detected the same information through the Divine Protection of the Earth Spirits, Otto Suwen obtained the same information through the Divine Protection of The Soul of Language, and so Otto Suwen spoke.

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [――I hear that there is a so-called "Great Disaster" drawing near that will endanger the Vollachian Empire. As General First-Class of the Empire! As a ”General” that has survived longer by living in disgrace! No matter what it takes! I cannot die without being of service to His Excellency, the Emperor!]

Being thus informed by the large man that had been chained to a wall underground――the person that introduced himself as Goz Ralfon, Rem understood that problems other than the rebellion would shake the Imperial Capital.

Although Goz had been quite weak after only being given one meal every two days, he became  surprisingly energetic and recovered his vitality after  Rem's stop-gap healing magic.

She had thought the majority of that effect was probably largely due to his own conviction.

Goz: [Girl, your treatment has saved me! Normally, I would have liked to invite you to my home and introduce my savior to my wife and children, but now I must head to His Excellency’s side! I shall pay you back for this!!]

Rem: [Ah, umm,  yes.]

Goz: [If possible, leave here and join up with the regular army! General First-Class Moguro Hagane or General Second-Class Kafma Irulux shall do you no harm! Avoid the other General’s First-Class! Your words will not get through to them!]

Having been released from his chains,  Goz had thus declared in an extremely loud voice, leapt out of the basement at a tremendous speed, and, after rebuking the soldiers guarding the mansion, ordered them to accompany him to the Crystal Palace, which was visible from a distance.

In response to that, the attitude of the guards was divided in two.

It seemed that even the mansion’s soldiers were divided between those who knew of Goz’s existence and those who did not. Those who were kept in the dark were not amused, while those to whom the information had been disclosed were that much more trusted by Berstetz.

Therefore――,

Goz: [I see. You lot will stand in my way?]

With nothing to wear and his bare upper body covered with an armor of muscle, Goz fixed his eyes on the guards who had drawn their weapons and blocked his way.

Goz was unarmed, and the time he had been confined was not just a day or two. He was far from being in perfect condition. However, the fact that the guards had opposed him was not a matter of whether or not they had a chance of winning.

Goz: [That is good. Just as I am loyal to His Excellency, the Emperor, you lot are loyal to the Prime Minister. I shall certainly see that honor through to the end!!]

The overwhelming aura emanating from him was clear, even as he looked at the soldiers opposing him.

Goz’s one-sided bare-knuckle fighting style that followed was also like that.

A huge fist was swung, and in a single shot, several guards were blown away.

The slight advantage in numbers had not made a difference. It was a moment of overwhelming control.

Rem: [I heard your name from Abel-san as one of the Nine Divine Generals, but...]

Actually, the only real Nine Divine Generals Rem had seen in person were Arakiya and Madelyn in the Fortress City of Guaral.

Even compared to both of them, Goz's presence would not be outdone.

He may be at a disadvantage now, but only in what could be accorded to weapons, equipment and exhaustion.

Goz: [You fought well! That is why you are the Sword Wolves of the empire!!]

Right in the middle of the battered soldiers, Goz thrusted his arms up in the air and passionately uttered his praise.

If she was not mistaken, she had heard that he was the person that had risked his life and became a sacrifice in order to free the real emperor, Abel, but he was in such good spirits that it seemed like a lie that he had been exhausted from being tied up.

It was unclear why he had been tied up in the basement of the mansion.

Goz: [Once again, Prime Minister Berstetz Fondalfon! I shall not let things go according to your plans! You too, General First-Class Chisha! Uooooooh-――!!]

Before they could discuss things in detail, Goz had boldly dashed out of the main gate of Berstetz's mansion with the guards who were on his side.

Overwhelmed by the valor of The Lion Knight, Rem could do nothing but watch his back as he left.

However――,

Rem: [There’s no need for me in that castle.]

In an unexpected turn of events, the soldiers in the mansion were gone, and Rem was also no longer hindered by disability.

Rem checked to see if the soldiers who had been struck down by Goz were alive or dead, and after giving only minimal treatment to the seriously wounded, she used one of the long swords as a cane as she moved around the mansion, heading to a room she had entered many times.

And then――,

Rem: [Katya-san, it's me; it’s Rem. Please come out]

Katya: [...I absolutely do not want to come out. W-What was that loud voice just now?"

Rem: [I know how you feel. But, the person with the loud voice has already left. I think we should talk about what we are going to do from now on.]

Katya: [What we’re going to do...]

Rem's voice through the door, in front of Katya's room, who didn't allow her to see her, urged her to make a decision.

At present, Goz's bravery, for better or worse, has wiped out the mansion's soldiers, so the urgency to leave the mansion has diminished.

However――,

Rem: [Great Disaster...]

That is why Goz hastened to meet the Emperor, who was said to be in the Crystal Palace.

To be precise, the main reason Goz went to the Crystal Palace was to confront the imposter who pretended to be the emperor. Nevertheless, it is true that the purpose is to prevent that mysterious disaster.

In any case, Goz's advice was against sitting still.

If that’s the case――,

Katya: [I, I don't have a reason to leave here. I, I'm a hostage.]

Ram: [There are no more guards left to detain us. There is no longer any reason to keep being held hostage.]

Katya: [Bu, but still…]

Rem: [―― I understand. At least open the door. I would like to see you safe.]

Rem was at a loss, and yet Katya, who was undaunted by her insistence, folded.

After a few moments of silence at Rem's last request, the wheels of the wheelchair were heard moving, and the door was unlocked. And so, the door to the room is opened.

Rem: [Excuse me. Let's go.]

Katya: [Huh? Wai-, you!]

Rem: [I'm sorry. That was a lie that I just wanted to see you safe..]

After entering the room, Rem found Katya by the door and quickly walked behind her and pushed her wheelchair out of the room.

A panicked Katya tried to resist, but she was powerless to stop the wheels, unable to resist against Rem's forceful action, and was pushed along.

Katya: [Wait! I have someone I have to wait for, here…]

Rem: [I understand that perfectly well. But it is not safe to wait here. Even if we wait for your fiancé, let's at least go somewhere safe.]

Katya: [Safe? There is no safer place in the Imperial Capital than here――]

There is no reason for this, Katya was probably trying to say.

But Katya, who was in the middle of her speech, suddenly opened her eyes and turned to look up while twisting her head left and right to glare at the Rem behind her.

Katya's reaction caused Rem to look up and see a large shadow above their heads as they walked down the hallway of the mansion.

――A massive, human-shaped castle wall straddles the mansion, a step toward the interior of the Imperial Capital.

Rem: [――――]

Rather than Goz's rampage, it is more shocking to see a giant foot stomping and bounding through the city, passing close at hand, than any of the attacks by the rebels trying to invade the Imperial Capital.

Rem and Katya looked at each other in alarm as the wheels of Katya's wheelchair lifted off the ground with the sound and impact of the earth shaking.

Katya: [It, it doesn't seem like a safe place to be here, for sure…]

Rem: [Yes. Let’s hurry.]

As expected, the giant step now was one of the exceptions in this whole fiasco, but it would be foolish for Rem to go out of her way to say that and incur Katya's displeasure.

Katya obediently followed by Rem, pushing her wheelchair, headed for the,

Katya: [Your companion is on bed rest, isn't he? What are you going to do?]

Rem: [He really shouldn't move around too much. However, I can't say that...]

In response to Katya's words, Rem reaches the intended room with her.

Inside is Flop O'Connell, who was brought to the mansion with Rem and has not fully recovered from his serious wounds, and is under house arrest.

As per her answer to Katya, he should preferably be left to rest if at all possible but――,

Rem: [Flop-san, it's me. May I come in?]

Flop: [Mmm, Wife-san! I'll open it now.]

Rem knocked on the door and received a quick response, followed immediately by the opening of the door. Rem and Katya's eyes widened when they saw that Flop, who had apparently been lurking by the door, was tightly holding a small hand mirror.

Rem: [Um, Flop-san, what's with the mirror?]

Flop: [Well, actually, in case you were wondering, it was meant to be a weapon. You heard some very loud voices earlier, didn't you? The city is getting noisy, and I thought someone hostile might come barging in.]

Flop answers while twirling the hand mirror, reminding Rem and Katya that they were prisoners of war and hostages for the time being, so there were no tools in their rooms that could be used as weapons.

However, a mirror as a countermeasure is not ideal.

Rem: [...you mean you are able to fight with that mirror?]

Flop: [Unfortunately, this is about all there was in the room. But I've never fought with a mirror before, so maybe I have a talent for sleeping! What do you think, Wife-san?]

Rem: [I guess so. I'd like to stop talking about unnecessary things and do what's necessary.]

Flop responds to Katya's glare in his usual tone of voice, reassuring in his own way, but at the same time she wanted to put this aside for a while in such a dire situation.

Regardless――,

Rem: [She is Katya-san. I met her at this mansion.]

Flop: [I'm Flop O'Connell. You must be a friend of Wife-san's whom I heard so much about.]

Katya: [...I, I don't remember becoming friends with this girl, but.]

" If that's the case, then you should be ready to do so. Making good friends is a key to a better life. Even if you don't, there's nothing wrong with having a lot of friends.]

Katya: [I'm probably not as good as you are…]

As Rem expected, Flop has a personality that Katya is not very comfortable with. Nevertheless, Flop's disposition is such that he does not mind if Katya is frank with him, so it is the best situation if Katya is just bitter about it.

Rem: [Flop-san, the situation in the Imperial Capital right now is…]

Flop: [I know more or less about it. Madelyn-kun came to say hello to me before she left for the battle.]

Rem: [...Madelyn-san said hello?]

From an unexpected personal connection, she knew that Madelyn had been visiting Flop, but she had never expected that they would be friends, even coming to greet him before going off to battle.

However, if a Nine Divine General had spoken to him directly, it is even possible that Flop would know more about the situation outside than Rem.

Rem: [Well then, we can talk quickly about it. The guards of the mansion are already gone, so we should be able to stay or escape at our leisure, but… I say we should escape.]

Katya: [I wonder if that has anything to do with the loud noises and the terrible earthquakes that just happened?]

Rem: [Yes. But it's not just that. Something even worse could happen.]

Katya: [Wo, Worse than that! Ar, Are you kidding me…?]

In response to Rem's concern to Flop, Katya turns pale and trembles when she hears it.

This is not about scaring Katya into obeying, but rather about a real, though unconfirmed, possibility of danger. On the other hand, it is no more than "something could happen," so it does not provide any assurance to make a move.

Flop: [Still, I think you should leave here, Wife-san.]

Rem: [――Yes.]

Asked by Flop, Rem nodded without hesitation.

Although under house arrest, life in the mansion was not so uncomfortable. Although they were not allowed to leave the premises, they were allowed to go to each other's rooms, Flop's wounded body was taken care of, Rem was able to meet Katya, and there was no reason for any great anger or hatred toward Berstetz, who was supposed to be their enemy.

As for the reason for Berstetz's rebellion, Rem has a suspicion that it is Abel = Vincent who is at fault, all the more. 

Nevertheless, leaving such circumstances aside, Rem's feelings are probably the most decisive reason why she wants to leave the mansion.

Staying in captivity like this would worry a number of people who have been good to Rem.

That is the reason why she needed to get out of such an unjust and dishonest situation as soon as possible.

Flop: [Okay, I got you. I have no objection either, Wife-san and Miss Katya, let's get going.]

Rem: [Are you sure?]

Flop: [Even if I stay, there's not much I can do other than lie in bed. I'm still a peddler, so I have to be somewhat physically active, or I get anxious.]

Flop makes a clenched fist as he chuckles, as if to keep Rem from getting upset. Then he interjects with a "Besides,"

Flop: [Actually, I've been entrusted with the message. If I accidentally oversleep and missed the opportunity to tell it, I wouldn't be able to face the world or my sister for that matter.]

Rem: [Message… who is it from?]

Flop: [The Sword-Wolf of the Empire, who has taken on the stigma of a traitor himself and, in my opinion, has taken a great gamble.]

Flop winks with one eye closed, and Rem looks flustered at the reply.

Apparently, it was not the person Rem had in mind, but it was nice to know that Flop would be coming along.

Rem: [As you can see, it would be no small feat to push Katya-san's wheelchair while carrying Flop-san on my back, so…]

Katya: [You're asking me what to do, but you have no intention of letting me do it, do you!"

Rem: [As long as you all are not in danger, I'd be happy to leave you alone…]

As long as it is not safe to take them out by force, there is no other choice but to do so. As expected, Rem does not intend to save them beyond the extent of her ability, but if she can do so, then she has no choice.

One does so even if it twists the other person's feelings. ――knowing that it doesn't look good from the outside.

Rem: [――――]

For a moment, Rem felt like she was doing the same thing as a hand extended toward her, and her heart fluttered with mixed emotions.

Rem quickly shook off the feeling and nodded to Katya and Flop with a "Well then,"

"Be careful when we leave the mansion. If we encounter someone, be cautious. We don't know the people who are coming into the Imperial Capital either.]

Katya: [Don't say scary things. …Aren't you injured? Can you even go?]

Flop: [Haha, thanks for your concern. Fortunately, Wife-san has been working her healing magic with dedication. The gouged flesh is filling in, and I think my blood is coming back. As for my physical condition, I guess I'll just have to ask you to give me a shout when you're ready to move.]

Rem: [I will take that into consideration. My legs are not in perfect shape, and Katya-san is in a wheelchair.]

Once again, she realizes that each of the three gathered here are physically uncertain. Still, it was crucial for them to join forces, as they could not afford to lose anyone.

And so, with much enthusiasm,

Flop: [By the way, Wife-san, what about all the other people who are being held prisoner beside us?]

Rem: [I forgot about that…]

Flop pointed that out, and Rem put a hand to her forehead.

There is a separate building in the mansion, and in that building are being held captives besides Rem and the others, ――including several who claim to be the Black-Haired Crown Prince, the illegitimate son of the Emperor of Vollachia.

Most of them were apparently used as a cause to rebel against the Emperor, but to Berstetz, who had rebelled over the issue of the Emperor's heir, this wasn’t someone else’s problem, so they were kept as prisoners of war whenever possible to ascertain whether they were genuine.

Rem: [Frankly, they couldn’t be said to be either our enemies nor our allies, so I want to ignore them.]

Currently, aside from Katya, the position of Rem and Flop was very complicated and difficult.

Although she had no strong cause or claim, she had reluctantly joined the rebel group led by Abel. However, she had been separated from that group and was not acquainted with the group of captive princes.

They did not know if they were right or wrong, and their attitude toward Rem’s group was unknown.

???: [――――]

That was why her opinion was as she had just stated.

However, leaving them in the locked detached building while Rem’s group left the mansion to escape from the looming, incomprehensible Great Disaster, was distressing for them.

Even if it was difficult to pick everyone up, they wanted to diminish casualties as much as possible.

That was why the guards who were beaten down by Goz were given the minimal amount of treatment.

Katya: [...Why don't we just find the key and hang it where they can retrieve it themselves?]

Rem: [Ah…]

Katya: [I, I don’t know. I don’t know, but if it’s dangerous, I don't want to get involved. But I can’t help but hesitate. Is it strange!?]

Rem: [No, no, it’s not strange. Right?]

Seeing Rem worried, Katya offered a compromise.

Rem, who had only one of two options in mind: to help or not to help, felt saved by Katya's words.

As she said, it would be fine to locate the key to the detached building and make sure the captives have a little trouble obtaining it. That should ensure the captives’ safety and their own peace of mind.

Flop: [Seems you’ve got everything covered.]

Flop nodded in satisfaction at the settlement of Rem’s and Katya's conversation.

Meanwhile, he had been braiding some of his own long blonde hair then gently placed his hand on the door. While pushing it open,

Flop: [Well, for now, I need to find where the key to the detached building is…wait here a sec.]

Flop, who was about to go through the door, closed it while withdrawing his earlier words. Rem and Katya widened their eyes at his sudden action.

However, Flop put his finger to his lips and said, "Be quiet," then opened the door slightly to look outside. Standing beside Flop, Rem also looked outside.

Rem: [――Ah]

Katya: [He, hey, what is it? I don't have a good feeling about your reaction at all…!]

When Rem found out why Flop had closed the door, she choked and Katya's voice trembled at their reaction.

But she could not immediately find words to relieve Katya's anxiety.

That was because for both Rem and Flop, it was a scene outside the realm of their imagination.

In the courtyard of Berstetz's mansion, figures other than the soldiers stood there.

They were――,

Flop: [...Somehow, they look sickly pale, don't they? Is it from a lack of sleep?]

The appearance of the figures enveloped in a bloody atmosphere was so strange that Flop's joke sounded dry.

A pale complexion with no signs of life and cracks running across the visible skin――a group of people, bearing features that could be recognized at a glance as bizarre, were occupying the mansion of the Imperial Prime Minister.

△▼△▼△▼△

Flop: [...At a glance, they all had the appearance of Imperial Soldiers, didn’t they?]

Shutting the door without a noise, Flop muttered, as Rem and Katya held their breath.

In frankness, the scene they had put their eyes on had been so alien that Rem, bereft of the composure to do as much as to pay attention to the details, was unable to agree with Flop’s irresponsible claim.

It was just that――,

Katya: [S-some creepy people are entering the mansion… Doesn't that mean someone from the rebel army is trying to kill His Excellency the Emperor?]

Rem: [The vibe I got from them was different, like they’re impossible to communicate with. It wasn't like they were angry or overexcited or anything like that…]

Flop: [It's like they were a creature that’s not human, but in human form. I also got the feeling that talking to them and being understood would be hard. My wounds are hurting me, that’s a bad omen.]

Whether she wanted to or not, Rem agreed with Flop's opinion.

As she had not checked what laid outside, Katya had not seen the things the other two were referring to, but she surely would have been shaken had she looked.

Looking at her friend, who she felt had quite a different sense of logic, Rem had a sudden brainwave.

Rem: [Don't tell me, that's the Great Disaster…?]

She had only heard of the expression “Great Disaster” from Goz, but she supposed it was something nefarious regardless of its exact nature. Having heard about it being imminent, and having laid eyes on the beings outside, however, she could not help but believe there was a connection between the two.

Moreover, that was Rem’s intuition as a practicioner of healing magic.

Rem: [It didn’t feel like there was life in them. It was as if…]

Katya: [Y-you’re not going to say they’re dead people, right? Calling them something like Hollows, is ridiculous…] [1]

Flop: [Though, laughing that off might be too hasty. The ones outside were dressed like Imperial Soldiers, and come to think of it, their armor, as well as their faces and napes, might not have been in a good shape. Perhaps there’s a chance they still have the wounds they got in life… What do you say?]

Katya: [What do I say, I don't know!]

Flop’s expression, true to his nature, caused Katya to lose her head and dart her eyes about in bewilderment.

But the fact that she was rejecting it vehemently served as undeniable proof that proof that she, too, had perceived that something abnormal was happening from Rem and Flop’s behavior.

Even worse than that was――

???: [――Gyah!]

???: [Guh!]

???: [Ah.]

Small wails of pain were heard in succession, wails from the guards outside who had been put to sleep―― having been beaten down by Goz. Rem had deferred their treatment for later, yet they now spilled their death cries.

In frankness though, it was not like she had ascertained it with her own eyes. 

Flop: [...Seems it's going to be hard to talk and reach a mutual understanding with them.]

Flop's words, his cheeks tightening greatly, told of the ultimate fate of the soldiers whose concealment had not been possible.

Those enigmatic forces, their face pallid, had bestowed the collapsed soldiers with the coup de grace. Allowing zero margin for discussion. ――That Rem, and everyone else, would be an exception to this rule, was difficult to envision.

Rem: [I…]

Had she at least put the soldiers in some room, would it have been different?

Had they been moved to a safe place, in which they could stay collapsed and defenseless, their arbitrary demise could have been avoided. That being the case, the onus for their deaths would lie with Rem, who had not done everything possible.

Katya: [――Hk, is this the time to be thinking about that!]

Rem: [K-Katya-san…]

Katya: [If you get depressed now, all three of us will die for sure, isn’t that right? I-I don’t want… anything like that…!]

As Rem cast her face downwards in chagrin, it was seized by both of Katya's hands, one hand on each cheek, and the former’s head was raised by force. A teary-eyed Katya snapped at Rem as to reproach her, attempting to obliterate Rem’s fainthearted disposition.

Katya’s momentum, and wholly honest words made Rem catch her breath.

Nodding quietly after that,

Rem: [Flop-san, the situation has changed. We have to go unlock that one separate building.]

Flop: [Uh-huh, we do, Wife-san. I was thinking the same thing. I don't know if we’ll be able to get on friendly terms with the Crown Prince-kuns who’ve been detained in that building, but there’s always the train of thought that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.]

Rem: [Yes. With a common enemy, there’s the possibility that we can work side-by-side.]

Flop immediately approved the change of plans. In a consensus with Rem and Flop, Katya shook her head up and down, in agreement, and spoke,

Katya: [With that settled, get on with it, get on with it already! Do your best at breaking the lock to the detached unit. Y-you can do it, right?]

Rem: […Fortunately, I picked up a sword that can be use in place of my walking stick, so I can use that.]

It seemed like the sword would break, but in exchange, she would be able to destroy the lock on the door, at least.

No longer would it be possible for them to walk around the mansion searching for the key. It would be too difficult.

Flop: [We need to get there before they turn their attention to the detached building, but the problem is…]

Rem: [Katya-san's wheelchair …]

All eyes were on the wheelchair.

The wheelchair, which had been a gift from her fiancé, was a very well-made, high-end one, but that notwithstanding, it would not be possible to conceal its sounds, those of the wheels turning, and those of its many parts operating.

It was not ideal for situations in which one had to move without being detected.

Katya: [I… I …]

Confronted by that same tough challenge, Katya's gaze flickered left and right and up and down, incoherently.

However, seeing as she possessed a physical disability, Katya and her wheelchair were inseparable. She herself was aware of this, and after a few moments of anxiety from her, Katya spoke.

Katya: [Leave me, and go open the detachment. I-I'll wait for you alone…]

Rem: [Alone… But I can’t do such a…]

Katya: [I’ll lock myself in my room! They won’t know I’m there if I shut myself in there in silence, don’t think? If those people are dead or anything of the sort, it's probably safer to stay hidden and not do anything stupid. I-I’m not going to tell you two to do anything dangerous.]

The fact that she was speaking so quickly, and that her voice had gone up in pitch, was no more than evidence that her innermost thoughts were frantic.

But that Katya’s proposal came from her mustering the entirety of what paltry courage she possessed, was something Rem and Flop comprehended to a painful extent.

Her feelings, her faith, ought not, by any means, be rejected.

Rem: [Flop-san, stay with Katya-san and…]

Flop: [No, you have to take Miss Katya's determination in mind, Wife-san. The chances of success are higher if it’s the two of us going at it. Worst-case scenario, one of us could serve as a decoy.]

Rem: [――――]

That truly was the worst-case scenario, but if she were to avert her gaze from that which she wished to not think about, she would be overwhelmed once she actually found herself in that situation.

Therefore, despite taking into account that the worst-case would overwhelm her, Rem assented with a nod.

Rem: [Without fail, I’ll unlock the detached building and return.]

Katya: [G-get it together. It’s no good if you don’t come back too. Promise!]

Rem: [――I do.]

Holding Katya's hand, she and Rem exchanged firm promises.

Bearing Katya’s concern, so clumsy she was, Rem kept its weight within her heart as to not forget it. And with that, Rem nodded to Flop, and they exited the room.

Flop & Rem: [――――]

While stifling their breaths and concealing their bodies, the two of them made their way out into the corridor, and as they surveyed their surroundings―― in search for those eerie “enemies”, they managed to advance towards the back of the mansion, where the separate unit laid.

As they made their way, wafting in the wind was the scent of blood belonging to the soldiers that had been slain. A deed performed by the enemies, their number in the tens, wandering through the mansion with perilous strides.

Rem: […Looks like they’re looking for something.]

Flop: [People who are alive, perhaps?]

Rem: [No, I get a feeling like, they took out those on guard duty while they were at it. There aren't enough people for them to comb the mansion that thoroughly, it’s likely they have a much more definite target.]

Keeping their bodies low while en route, Rem and Flop exchanged opinions on the enemies’ behavior.

Hearing Flop's keen insight brought Rem some vexation, feeling as if she were always off-mark every step of the way.

Flop: [I don't know about my idea either, I just thought of it.]

And, to have Flop smooth over things frustrated her.

At the very least, she would contribute to freeing those imprisoned in the separated building, thus making up for it.

Rem: [――That wouldn’t be enough, would it.]

Something that ought be called fortunate, however, was that the sensory functions of the strange-looking "enemies" did not seem to differ much from those of humans, nor had they been boosted with incredible abilities beyond Rem and Flop’s grasp.

Thanks to that, somehow, they had managed to approach the separate unit while avoiding detection. Though, a problem arose then.

Flop: [As expected, they didn't fail to notice it completely, huh?]

Having witnessed the same sight Flop had, Rem nodded in silence, agreeing with the former’s words.

As they hid behind the building and examined the unit’s surroundings, the problem, three figures belonging to “enemies”, could be seen. As they were searching for something, it would be unnatural for them not to stop by such a conspicuous structure.

The problem was the building’s interior; if the Crown Princes were truly confined within, the “enemies” would massacre the former without a word edgewise the moment they broke through the door.

There was no time to lose. If they did not act this very instant, their lives would be forfeit.

Flop: [Wife-san, I'll distract them. Can you do it while I keep all three occupied?]

Rem: [――――]

Flop: [I don’t mind if we reverse our roles, Wife-san, but I think it’s more likely that you succeed than me with my lack of nerve. I need you to decide now.]

A forceful declaration, but a decision was necessary.

Taking that in, Rem closed her eyes for a second, then quickly opened them.

And then――,

Rem: [Let's do it. I’ll go around the back. Flop-san, it’ll take only a second.]

Flop: [Yeah, I’ll leave it to you. I don’t want to boast, but serving as a decoy’s one of my strong points.]

Rem nodded to Flop’s answer of reliability, and they then split up.

With the three "enemies" right in front of the building’s entrance, while they planned to breach the large door, Rem and Flop separated in different directions, as if to sandwich their foes.

Rem: [――――]

Squeezing onto it, Rem ascertained the feel of the steel sword she had carried for the purpose of breaking the lock.

Never had she had experience wielding the sword, nor did wounding another bring her elation. If anything, breaking Subaru's finger was all Rem’s battle experience amounted to. It was possible to say that it was far from a solid foundation for her self-confidence.

But whether she had confidence in herself or not was irrelevant. She had to do it.

Do-or-die.

Flop: [Heyhey, gentlemen, how are you doing? I’m a peddler with nothing to sell. At present, I just want to make myself known!]

Abruptly, Flop slipped out from behind the building, apparently starting a conversation with the "enemies".

Although he had to draw their attention on the spur of the moment, and although there had not been any major preparation done in advance, Flop’s demeanor was far too assertive as to slip by them.

Enemy: […Who the hell are ya?]

Riveted by Flop’s entrance, the “enemies” turned around, one of them apparently uttering so.

Their voice was cold and devoid of warmth, yet in it dwelled definite intelligence, which had come to Rem as a fairly large surprise, having presumed that communicating with them, let alone negotiating, would be impossible.

However――.

Flop: [Oh my, perhaps you can speak? Assuming you can, then maybe I should change my attitude, don’t you think?]

Enemy: [Ahh, ya’ve got it wrong, then. Everyone in the Empire’s gonna die.]

Flop: [I see. ――Turns out there’s no margin for negotiation after all!]

So did Flop loudly assert, as to veil over the savage reply given by the “enemy”. A unequivocal cue for Rem’s heart to melt, in whom hesitation had emerged for a moment, so that she would stir.

Having heard things thus far, Rem did not hesitate in her subsequent action.

Rem: [Ah, AHHHHHH――!]

The moment she resolved herself to make her move and initiate her assault, albeit she knew she ought to be silent, she emitted sound. Were she to forgo raising her own moral in that manner, from within, she would not be able to continue with said subsequent action.

Pulling the sword from its scabbard, she held it aloft, and with might and main, she thrusted it at an “enemy’s” back turned to her. They raised a shriek of “Wha!?”, but twice, thrice she swung the sword in a daze.

Not granting the “enemies” who had turned their attention to Flop a chance to turn around, a chaotic series of strikes rang out ensued. She knew not what would it take to incapacitate her opponents from doing battle, nor how long it would take her, hence she swung the sword with reckless abandon.

A hard sensation bounced off her hand the rest of it is pretty blurry, though she remembers feeling it.

Just then――,

Flop: [Wife-san! Everything's okay, we got them!]

Rem: [Ah…]

Rem came to her senses and saw Flop's figure in front of her.

When Rem looked for the enemy who was supposed to be between her and him, she found pieces of what used to be the vanquished enemy scattered under her feet.

Rem's eyes widened with a "huh" when she saw the completely unexpected way they fell down.

Flop: [To my eyes, it looked like they had been cracked. In fact, when you look at the remains like this, it looks like they're cracked like pottery or glass.]

Rem: [Do you think they are… dead.]

Flop: [I think it's doubtful that they were even alive, at least before they were shattered like this.]

Crouching down, Flop answers, pinching the scattered pieces of the enemy between his fingers.

Hearing his answer, Rem became terribly distressed to realize exactly the kind of answer she was expecting.

For Rem, taking the life of a living creature is an abhorrent thing that should be avoided as much as possible.

So, she realized that she had a shallow expectation that she wanted to protect her heart by defining what her vanquished enemy was, living or non-living.

Flop: [Wife-san, their companions will soon find out as well. Let's hurry and get to the separate room and open it up.]

Flop made the decision to put off Rem's sentiments for the moment, and Rem did not object to Flop's thinking that it was the right thing to do.

At the very least, he tries to give legitimacy to his actions as he realizes that he is about to open the door to the separate room.

Rem: [Huh?]

The fragments of the shattered "enemy" under her feet wriggled unnaturally in a way different from the wind or an earthquake.

Rem: [――They don't die easily. They should be dead.]

Just as Rem felt a creeping sensation of unease, she heard the voice of the enemy slip into the room.

Turning around, Rem sees the reanimation of the enemy that she and Flop had vanquished. The broken pieces of pottery are brought together as if time had reversed, showing cracks like seams, but they are restored to their original state.

Rem and Flop: [――――]

Both Rem and Flop froze in place, stunned by the improbable sight.

Quickly, Rem decided to do the opposite of what Flop had done when he had protected her in Guaral, and put all of her strength into her legs, hoping that she could at least protect Flop.

However, her turbulent mind affected her knees, and her crippled legs would not let her do so.

Rather, it created a fatal collapse of her posture in front of the enemy.

She has to raise her sword. Faster than her opponent, yet.

It will not be in time.

Rem: [――Hk.]

There was a flash of gray, dull light, and the enemy was about to mercilessly strike down Rem and Flop with the sword in his hand ――just at that moment.

???: [――El!]
???: [Minya!!]

Two high-pitched voices overlap, ushering in the extraordinary phenomenon that occurred immediately afterward in front of Rem's eyes.

In front of her eyes, purple crystals hit the three sword-wielding enemies from behind and pierced their chests. The surprise did not end there.

???: [Guh.]

The next moment, in a scream of pain, the enemy's whole body turned into the same dark purple crystal that had pierced its chest, and it shattered once again.

The only difference is that the enemy, now in purple fragments, showed no signs of being reformed.

And the one who did it, narrowly saving Rem and Flop, was――,

???: [――Kept you waiting, Rem! The real star has stepped on the stage!]

Bravely declaring so, a small figure jumps down from a large horse that has leapt over the outer wall and infiltrated the grounds of the mansion.

Then, the black-haired, nasty-looking-eyed boy, holding a little girl in a dress up in his arms, turned to Rem, closed one eye, and flashed a toothy smile at her.

Rem was left speechless at the flamboyant appearance and declaration, and then said.

Rem: [――Who are you?]

The young boy who appeared so gallantly, was someone who, at least in Rem's eyes, was unknown.

△▼△▼△▼△

――There was a loud, violent knocking on the door, causing Katya to feel a chill run down her spine.

Katya: [No, no, no, Don’t come in, don’t come closer…]

Pushing her wheelchair to the back of the room, she clutches her curly hair and prays desperately.

She sent Rem and Flop away and announced that she would wait alone for a while. Katya was going to stay hidden as long as possible, even breathing as little as she can.

And yet, the "enemy" is aware of their existence, and now she is scared to death.

Katya: [I'm unlucky. I've always been so, so, unlucky…]

The fact that the enemy stumbled upon this room was only the result of a random chance in an attempt to find survivors. However, her luck was terrible, because it was so easy for them to find her.

Maybe the Rem and Flop will not come back in time. Such a convenient thing would never happen to her.

Katya: [...Brother.]

Obviously, she was not able to see the other party outside the door.

However, according to Rem and Flop, the third party, which was neither imperial soldiers nor rebels, wandering around outside had the appearance of the dead.

Thinking of the dead, the first person that came to Katya's mind was her own brother, Jamal Aurélie. The unexpected death of the brother who seemed to be unkillable.

Even as a Hollow, she could not help but think that she would like to see him at least one more time.

However, when it came to the mysterious situation of the dead actually walking around, all that came to mind was not an obsession with her brother, but self-pity, and it was all very unseemly.

She cannot even have such lofty compassion to pray for Rem and Flop's safety and hope that they survive in her stead. All she has is self-love, self-love for herself, which she cannot help.

I am just an imperfect and helpless person who doesn't deserve to be loved by anyone.

Katya: [I'm the kind of…]

Anticipating, hoping, and wishing to be saved was a mistake in itself. By thinking such brazen thoughts, Rem and Flop may have become collateral damage.

Is this not the result of Katya's bad luck and failure in getting the Rem and Flop involved?

Katya's throat freezes as these endlessly desperate thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the creaking door, now finally beginning to show signs of being smashed open.

In the face of such a hopeless situation, she curses her body, seemingly incapable of even making a satisfying scream.

However――,

Katya: [Huh?]

Just when she thought the door was about to be smashed open.

On the other side of the door, the enemy that was trying to break in stopped moving. ――Or, more precisely, the destruction had stopped.

The enemy's entire body burst into flames, enveloped in red.

And then――,

???: [That Micro Spirit I scared into doing that was my last one.]

Katya heard a new voice from the other side of the door, different from that of the enemy being burned.

Katya looked up as if she had been startled by the sound of the abusive voice. Katya then turned the wheel of her wheelchair and voluntarily attached herself to the door.

With a trembling hand, she unlocked the door she had been afraid to open, and opened it.

Behind the door, a man was standing, kicking the burnt and charred corpse of the enemy.

???: [Kept you waiting, Katya. ――Let's get out of here.]

He had lost his familiar bandana, and his normally upswept hair was down. Katya's eyes widened at the man, his forehead and cheeks covered in dried blood, reaching toward her.

Then, as she wheeled toward the man,

Katya: [Late… you are so late, you idiot! I, I would've died, if you hadn't killed them!]

And then she tearfully dove into her fiancé, who had ruthlessly made his appearance.

――At the Crystal Palace of the Imperial Capital, at the star-shaped ramparts, and at the rebel stronghold, various situations were unfolding. 

There were some who were aware of the circumstances, and others who knew absolutely nothing at all. 

Those people were all jumbled together on a battlefield transformed into a crucible of chaos―― no, the Vollachian Empire was what had been transformed. 

Where bloodshed was rife, where the loss of life, akin to leaves falling from a tree, was revered, where taking action for the sake of blossoming ambition was considered the right thing. Its vast lands pulsated, and those engraved into the history of the Empire arose one after the other. 

What could it be called, if not a nightmare? 

???: [――The Great Disaster.]

Indeed, if not to be designated as a nightmare, then it could only be designated as the Great Disaster.

The Stargazers, who infested the Vollachian Empire, had loudly proclaimed this to be one of the mass-scale disasters that would drive the world to ruination, as declared by the commandment they had been bestowed with. 

That in itself was a matter inconsequential to the crux that had brought about the circumstances known as the Great Disaster. 

The important thing was that this disaster induced the ruin of the Empire’s soil, and at its terminus, the wish would be fulfilled. 
For that purpose, the moves to be made, the measures to be exhausted, absolutely everything would be expended. 

Dying and bringing death, killing and being killed, through those means, amassed on the vast lands of Vollachia, were mountains of corpses. 

If the entirety of Vollachia’s spilled blood was the foundation of the plan, all that remained was.

???: [All that remains is to carry the plan out to the end. ――Deliberation: Required.]

With that, the bearer of the Great Disaster, the symbol of ruin, congratulated herself very, very quietly
