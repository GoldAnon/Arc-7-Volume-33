*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Cloud Dragon Mezoreia’s senility.

The startling revelation of the truth drove Emilia into a tremendously difficult corner.

Emilia: [I didn’t have to beat Volcanica at the time, all I had to do was do my best and complete the Trial, but…]

On the highest floor of the Pleiades Watchtower, her encounter with the Divine Dragon Volcanica was concluded by her touching a stone monument at the peak, even further above the tower.

As for Emilia, she was still unsure as to whether she had properly resolved Volcanica’s Trial; however, the ancient Dragon bestowed Emilia one of its claws as proof.

So, for now she considered this a symbol of approval.

However, her fight with Volcanica had fundamentally been a defensive one with no intention of beating him, so it was not a battle at all.

And this situation remained the same even if the opponent changed from the Divine Dragon to the Cloud Dragon.

If anything――,

Emilia: [I have no other choice but to beat it, but Mezoreia has lost――Ah!]

As she was saying this, Emilia leaped up from her spot and closed in on the Dragon from the air.

Shaking its long whiskers without revealing what was reflected in its eyes, the Dragon mercilessly slashed its claws toward the puny existence flying towards it.

It was a simple attack, but just one strike would be more than enough to kill someone if it connected.

The Dragon’s claws were much sharper than any run-of-the-mill sword and could easily cut Emilia’s body right in half.

Emilia: [Soldiers!]

However, Emilia was able to avoid this attack by jumping even further into the sky.

The midair foothold that Emilia used to jump was provided by an Ice Soldier who had jumped together with her and put up both of its arms for Emilia to jump off of.

Naturally, the Ice Soldier was late in escaping and fell prey to the Dragon’s claws, which smashed it to pieces. 

Emilia: [Eiya!!]

Keeping this sacrifice in her heart, Emilia’s long legs kicked Mezoreia in the face.

Emilia delivered this kick with footwear made of ice, which each had a large, extremely sharp spike, forming fiercely lethal weapons.

Since Emilia had used her foot, she did not pull any punches with this merciless kick――so an absurdly brutal blow slammed into the side of Mezoreia’s defenseless head.

However――,

Emilia: [It’s not working at all!]

Mezoreia’s huge body did not budge an inch from getting kicked in the face.

However, it appeared to be irritated. Feeling a sense of hostility on her skin, Emilia greatly swung her upper body to do a midair flip, using another ice soldier to dodge the incoming thrust from the Dragon.

Lacking behind the shattered one, another ice soldier had leapt even further up and stretched out both of its legs from above. Aligning both their soles, Emilia launched herself off of them towards the ground below.

While the sound of shattering ice resounded in her eardrums, Emilia landed on the white ground with her hand, and then looked up towards the majestic cloud-wreathed Dragon that calmly floated in the air.

Mezoreia: [――I, am Mezoreia. In accordance with the voice of mine dear child, I shalt become the wind from the heavenly skies.]

Emilia: [Geez… Even after all of that…!]

Even after being kicked in the face and smashing apart two ice soldiers with its claws, Mezoreia's words and demeanor did not change at all compared to when it had first descended upon the battlefield.

Emilia: [――――]

It must have considered Emilia to be an enemy.

It was precisely for this reason that it was brandishing its claws toward the approaching Emilia as it flapped its wings and turned its unfocused white eyes toward her.

But she just could not initiate a conversation. Just like with Volcanica, it was incredibly difficult to find common ground.

The only potential clue might be――,

Emilia: [――Madelyn! Just listen to me!]

Madelyn: [Be quiet! Don’t address this dragon so casually!!] 

Emilia's last ray of hope faded into the distance as her outstretched hand was violently shaken off.

Even though Madelyn had lost the Flying Winged Blade she was able to wield with remarkable skill, Emilia’s silver hair was still disheveled as she evasively leapt away. A small shadow followed right behind her――it was Madelyn Eschart, who let out a white exhale as her golden eyes were set ablaze, and cracked the ground with every step while brandishing her destructive arm.

Narrowly avoiding it, Emilia bit down on her molars.

The tactic of rapidly lowering the temperature had served its purpose of keeping the rampaging Madelyn and Mezoreia away from the others on the battlefield, but it was difficult to push it any further.

Madelyn: [Human, human, human…!!]

With a wicked glint in her eyes, Madelyn cloaked her small body in white steam. It felt like she was matching the cloud-wreathed Merzoreia, but there was a difference.

Madelyn’s body temperature was so absurdly high that every single snowflake evaporated once they came into contact――no, before they could even reach her.

The same thing was also happening around Mezoreia, the “Puck Copycat” tactic was not really effective on these two.

That being the case――,

Emilia: [Icicle Line――!]

With the ice wall separating the battlefields still in place, Emilia changed the flow of the cold air. Aborting an ineffective strategy to preserve her strength was not what she was doing.

Since she had covered too large of an area, it did not have the desired effect on Mezoreia and Madelyn.

Emilia: [I’ll hit you with all of this cold!]

Drawing invisible white lines around the head-on approaching Madelyn, Emilia concentrated the cold air permeating the battlefield around the second bastion into a single spot.

It was not just any ordinary cold; it was a truly extreme cold that wrapped around Madelyn’s small body, changing the steam into snow and causing the dragonkin’s body temperature to instantly plummet below freezing.

Madelyn: [――Guh!?]

Even Madelyn had her whole body frozen still by this unforeseeably extreme cold.

Madelyn’s eyes widened as her vision whited out; however, Emilia threw away her last bit of pity and focused on pouring all of her power into temporarily freezing her solid.

Emilia: [Please… Ah.]

Directing all of her power towards freezing Madelyn, Emilia prayed for Mezoreia to act.

The participation of the cloud-wreathed Cloud Dragon in the melee would force Emilia to halt her attack prematurely. However, in the corner of her field of view, she saw Mezoreia floating in the sky with an empty expression and no indication of wanting to interfere with Madelyn’s predicament.

Emilia: [Weird, but――]

In this situation, Mezoreia’s standstill helped her out a lot.

When Madelyn’s voice had called out, and Mezoreia made its appearance from the sky, Emilia realized that she was cornered into an even more hopeless situation. 

However, by the look of it, Madelyn and Mezoreia were not cooperating at all as they were continuously switching between one of them attacking on their own and the other standing idly by.

From Emilia's perspective, the situation continued while she alternated between opponents in a one-on-one fashion.

Of course, Emilia's stamina was still slowly being whittled away, and she could not think of Madelyn, nor Mezoreia, as opponents that she could easily take down in a one-on-one fight.

Nevertheless――,

Madelyn: [Yo, u…!]

Emilia: [I'm sorry, Madelyn. I think it would have been better if I could have properly talked to you. But, since you refuse to listen, I'm going to need you to be obedient now!]

Madelyn: [Guh――!]

Madelyn’s whole body violently creaked, and she flashed her sharp fangs as her eyes blazed.

However, once the inner part of her body was chilled to the very center of its core, even the extremely stout and vigorous dragonkin was unable to avoid her freedom being snatched away.

Madelyn: [――――]

Her blood and flesh, her bones and skin, all of it was frozen white; Madelyn was placed in ice by Emilia.

The ice concluded just before Madelyn’s hand, which she had suddenly stretched out, could reach Emilia’s chest. With her hands still pointed at Madelyn, Emilia looked at the immobile girl and let out a long exhale.

Emilia: [That, was a close one…]

Patting her chest in relief, Emilia lowered her eyebrows at the young girl that had been colored white.

She did not feel delighted nor regretful for having won nor lost. Above all else, this did not mark the end quite yet. 

Emilia: [Mezoreia! You may not understand what I’m saying, but you need to stop fighting! If you really can't communicate no matter what, then go home for today!]

Emilia had considered the possibility that Mezoreia would have become incredibly angry the moment she defeated Madelyn, so she was slightly relieved to see that Mezoreia did not make any movement. However, unable to let that relief slip through to her expression, Emilia glared at Mezoreia with a sharp look on her face.

She was trying to act like she still had plenty of strength left in her.

However, the truth was that Emilia actually did not have much strength remaining.

Although she had succeeded in freezing Madelyn in ice, she would need to continue keeping Madelyn chilled in order to maintain her in that frozen state. That, too, required the continued use of energy.

Hence, even though she had stopped Madelyn, it would be very difficult to fight Mezoreia.  

If possible, the best thing Mezoreia could do would be to turn back from here. 

That was why――,

Emilia: [In the case that you still want to keep going, then I also have a plan.]

With a sharp glare in her eyes, Emilia declared such to Mezoreia. ――It was a lie.

Even though she said it with immense confidence as she glared at Mezoreia, it was an outright lie that Emilia had any kind of plan. She thought that if she insisted, perhaps Mezoreia would think Emilia was dangerous and run away.

Following the example of Subaru and Otto, it was a rare bluff from Emilia.

Mezoreia: [――I, am Mezoreia. In accordance with the voice of mine dear child, I shalt become the wind from the heavenly skies.]

To which, a deep, low voice from Mezoreia's mouth replied so.

Emilia became disheartened by Mezoreia's undecipherable behavior, as it was unclear whether or not it could see what was before its eyes, but she was determined not to be defeated and did not decrease the severity of her gaze.

And then――,

Mezoreia: [――I, am Mezoreia. In accordance with the voice of mine…]

Emilia: […Huh?]

Mezoreia: [In accordance… with the voice… voice of… dear child…]

Mezoreia's words, which it had repeated over and over and over again no matter what she said to it, were cut off halfway through, immediately began to falter, and did not continue after. 

It was not just that. Mezoreia, who had been sitting peacefully within the snowy sky, frowned somewhat painfully, and began to sway its large head from side to side.

Emilia: [What’s wrong all of a sudden? Does your head hurt?]

Seeing the change in Mezoreia, Emilia's amethyst eyes widened in surprise.

It would only be natural that Mezoreia would lash out in anger when Madelyn was frozen in ice. It would be very troubling if it did that, but that would be easier to accept than this kind of weird reaction.

Above Emilia's head, as she worried about that, Mezoreia's movements came to an abrupt halt.

Mezoreia: [――――]

The Dragon, which had been shaking its head in pain, suddenly looked down with a serene expression. Met with the gaze of those white eyes, on a face that had grown out a long beard, Emilia let out a short "ah."

Now, for the first time, she felt as if she had been "seen" by Mezoreia's eyes.

In other words, it was a sign of will and intelligence dwelling within Mezoreia's eyes――,

Emilia: [Finally, we can talk――]

Mezoreia: [I thought I told you, human.]

Emilia: [Eh?]

With a low voice, resounding as if the sky had roared, the Dragon turned its head to face Emilia. She was pierced by its gaze; however, Emilia’s body stiffened because of a different kind of shock.

She was seen by something mightier than herself; that was not what had surprised her. 

The violent emotion in its voice was just like the one that had just been directed at her just a few moments before―― No, it was exactly the same.

Indeed, as if to confirm the stiffened Emilia's surprise, the Dragon continued.

Mezoreia: [This dragon doesn’t have anything to say to you.]

Emilia: [Madel――]

Upon seeing something unbelievable, Emilia involuntarily ceased her movement. 

Turning towards Emilia, the Dragon opened its mouth. Then, it simply exhaled. ――That breath became a white light, and the true essence of the Cloud Dragon filled the world. 

The dreadfulness of when a definite will dwelled within the Dragon’s power rained mercilessly down upon Emilia.

△▼△▼△▼△

The influence of battle battalions that intervened from the west spread everywhere across the battlefield.

Of course, the most affected by this battalion was the garrison at the fourth bastion, which was brought to the brink of collapse after suffering unparalleled damage in one fell swoop.

However, even if it was not a direct effect, it can be said that it was the third bastion that was more affected by the changes just when the Pleiades Battalion entered the war.

Originally, in order to empty one of the trump cards of the Imperial City Lupugana, the soldiers sent to the third bastion were supposed to be abandoned.

Zikr was told of the plan by Abel and was prepared to sacrifice himself. Through his planning, some of his soldiers ――the "People of Shudraq" had escaped the rays of the Magic Crystal Cannon, but that was only a small difference compared to the damage that would have been caused to the third bastion.

In any case, the third bastion's soldiers were expected to be lost in advance.

When they remained without being lost, Abel's calculation, which initially included the painful defeat of the rebels, was based on a faulty premise. However, there should be nothing wrong with the soldiers surviving. Immediately correcting the miscalculation, Abel crossed the original strategy with the current situation. 

As a result――、

Zikr: [That is High Countess Serena Dracroy’s Flying Dragon Squadron.]

In the midst of the battle with the stone golems, Zikr wielded his sword and whispered on his horse.

Their round eyes are turned toward the azure sky, half deprived of its color in white and red―― flying above the differing battlefields, winged brethren clashed and turned their fangs onto each other.

On one side is a group of natural flying dragons that follow the orders of "Flying Dragon General" Madeleine Eshardt and rampage about, their ferocious wildness unleashed.

And against them are the squadrons of flying dragons and flying dragon riders who fly with their partners on their winged backs and their blades of ferocity in their trusty sheaths.

The wild, unmanned flying dragons outnumber the unmanned flying dragons by far, but if one were to ask who is more competent in aerial combat, it is clearly the flying dragon riders.

Flying dragons in the wild give in to their overflowing wildness and violently swing their claws and fangs, but the handling of the flying dragon riders is more vivid and sophisticated than that. They avoid the fangs with a dexterity that makes them feel as if they are in the air, and the flying dragon riders use their weapons to puncture and drop the wings of the stray flying dragons one after another.

Zikr: [This is different.....]

Only Zikr, who is the general second-class of the Empire and is acquainted with the "General" of the flying dragon riders, is more or less out of his depth, when it comes to the wild flock of flying dragons led by Madelyn.

Nonetheless, the violence of their number was difficult to stop, and the fact that they were completely outnumbered in the walled city was a deep thorn in their hearts. This perception will be overturned again.

For better or worse, the authenticity of the traditional empire's “Flying dragon Taming" will certainly be witnessed.

Zikr: [If your majesty's plan works, I must follow suit.]

As Abel cut his cards, Senior Count Dracroy's flying dragon squadron is brought in, and the air control of the flying dragon herd that dominates the sky is weakened; Zikr is assured that he has time to look around.

 Although he rushed in from the front for the sake of morale, when it came time to engage in melee, Zikr was by no means competent as an individual soldier. He would give timely formation instructions and advance further within reach of the enemy.

The threat has not abated at all yet, so he proceeds to the reach of General Moguro Hagane, who has assimilated with the city wall.

Zikir: [I hope Miss Beatrice is safe…]

Then, occupying part of the sword-raising Zikr's mind was the girl with pale-colored hair in the extravagant dress - likely the life-saver Beatrice.

At the moment that the "Magic Crystal Cannon" was released, Zikr's vision, who was ready to die, saw the figure of the girl who threw herself in front of the approaching light and managed to do something about it.

 Beatrice, small to begin with, seemed to be the size of a pebble when she was even higher in the sky. Still, Zikr is convinced it's Beatrice.

 Once captured by his eyes, there is no mistaking the woman. That is Zikr’s special ability.

That's why Zikr can say it. It was Beatrice who managed to do something about the Magic Crystal Cannon.

The problem is that he can be sure that it wasn't something you could do at no cost.

Zikr: [Please, stay safe――!!]

In his heart of hearts, he would like to say out loud that Beatrice is the most worthy recipient of the Distinguished Service Award for her rewriting of the predicament, and he would like to appeal that she must be safely secured at all costs.

But Zikr, who avoided dying in the middle of the battle, has a role to play as a “General.”

So all Zikr could do was pray.

――He hoped that all of his remaining happiness would fall to that girl.

Meanwhile, just as Zikr was praying for the safety of those on the front lines, Taritta was witnessing the moment when the "Magic Crystal Cannon" was unnaturally scratched off, and who had accomplished it.

Taritta: [I was told to back off; luckily, I have a clear view of the battlefield but…]

The rebels were hit hard and managed to get back on their feet.Zikr, who was about to launch an assault with them, ordered the "People of Shudraq" to provide cover from the rear.

The decision not to include the Shudraqians in the general strike, to which Mizelda understandably complained, was accepted by Taritta, as Zikr would have thought it through.

That is unlikely.

Mizelda: [Unbelievable, we can't even help ourselves. The Shudraqians are being underestimated.]

Taritta: [Sister]

Looking back on what happened, Mizelda is right to be angry.

The Crystal Palace in the Imperial Capital was originally the castle where Abel lived.It is hard to believe that Abel did not know about the "Magic Crystal Cannon" equipped in the palace, and Zikr’s unnatural instructions are also hard to accept.

Perhaps it was Zikr’s own judgment that pushed the Shudraqians back.

Zikr, who was ready to become a sacrificial piece, and the Shudraqians, who were kept away from his companions - Mizelda said they were underestimated, but that's not true either.

It was Zikr's compassionate decision.

However–,

Taritta: [I, too, hold the same feelings as you sister. I'm not happy with Zikr's consideration.] 

Taritta came to the same conclusion as the militant Mizelda

Known as the “Womanizer”, Zikr knows how to treat women with more than a certain amount of respect, and Taritta and them have no right to say anything about how he should behave.

However, the “People of Shudraq” have no obligation to be told what to do or how to be Shudraqians.

So, Taritta gripped her bow forcefully and said,

Taritta: [Let's take that complaint directly to Zikr.]

Mizelda: [Hm, a good response. At this rate, Zikr and Jamal take all the good stuff from us. ――You hear that, brethren!!]

Mizelda, dexterously thrusting her prosthetic leg into the earth and raising a large machete, called out to her compatriots.

All of the arrayed Shudraq responded to Mizelda's words and Taritta's readiness with their eyes, faces, and voices, as if they were of the same mind.

Then, with great enthusiasm, they headed towards the front line of the third bastion protected by Moguro Hagane. Just as the Shudraq's group was about to march on――,

???: [――Seems like there’s quite the motivated group here.]

Hearing a cold, dry voice, Taritta and Mizelda turned around.

Taritta instantly grabbed an arrow from her quiver and lowered herself to a ready stance. The appearance of the other party was so abrupt that it made the People of Shudraq raise their vigilance.

However, the caution of Taritta and the others quickly melted at the sight of the other person’s appearance.

Slowly stepping on the grass, approaching from behind Shudraq's group was a girl with pink colored hair swaying in the wind―― and above all, a girl with a familiar face.

――No, that was not accurate either; the reason being that the girl before them was a different person from the one bearing the face that Taritta and the others knew.

???: [――? Is it just this girl’s imagination, or why are you staring at her in complete wonder? Because she appeared out of the blue? If that's the case, she just jumped off of a flying dragon.]

Taritta: [N-no. That's not what we're surprised about.]

Girl with pink colored hair: [If so, then come out with it.]

Taritta: [――Your face looks exactly like the one of a girl we know.]

The pink-haired girl tilted her head at the Shudraq's gaze. When Mizelda answered the girl's question, she glanced lightly at the girl’s light-crimson eyes.

Then, with a short breath, she said, "Is that so,"

Ram: [Did you get along well with that girl with the same face?]

Mizelda: [At least, we were rather fond of her.]

Mizelda answered the question of the girl with light-crimson eyes with a stern nod.

It might have been a statement on behalf of all of them, but Taritta had no objection to it. And all of Shudraq had an inkling of the identity of the girl in front of them.

Natsuki Subaru mentioned it once. ――He said she had a twin sister.

The twin sister with the identical face to the girl Taritta and her group knew muttered once more, "Is that so," and then,

Ram: [In that case, Ram is sure she and you guys will get along just fine.]

She stepped forward while stating that―― as if the way was cleared for Ram, the girl who proceeded like it was a matter, of course, stood before Taritta and Mizelda.

Taritta nodded as she gazed into those light-crimson eyes.

Taritta: [Yes, I hope so. What’s the situation?]

Ram: [Ram has got the gist of it, assuming that there aren't any cowardly women here right now, right?]

Looking around at the faces of the Shudraq, Ram quietly spoke.

She was able to see through the reason why the People of Shudraq were positioning themselves so far away from the battle for the third bastion occurring right in front of them.

After seeing through it, and acknowledging the thoughtfulness of the matter, she spoke,

Ram: [Men say things like "I'm worried about yooou~," and "You'd better stay baaack~," but Ram would prove them wrong. ――Telling them to mind their own business.]

Taritta: [I agree.]

Stating that, standing beside Ram, who was holding a wand, Taritta repeatedly nodded silently.

Compassion, care, and concern were not welcome by the Shudraq on the battlefield. Rather,  ways they had once discarded had to be taught to them.

With Ram feeling a kind of realization, she faced forward with Taritta following suit. Right between them, Mizelda lined up opposite them with a wild smile on her face.

And――,

Taritta: [I've never met you before, but I'm convinced. You're a warrior, just like Rem.]

△▼△▼△▼△

With a thud, a shock resonated to his very core, and a heavy weight was caught in his internal organs.

Those out-of-the-ordinary sensations continued once, twice, three times, four times, and the strain seemingly increased.

As the feeling of shackles around his hands and feet impeded his movements one after the other, he gave in to his violent urges to shake them off and step over them.

However――,

???: [Your approach is too straightforward. Kafma might let you get away with this but I am not haphazardly heading into a fight with an opponent at the outset."

???: [Kah]

With five outstretched fingers, the old man's face sank into the ground and disappeared, leaving behind his ridicule.

Immediately after looking him in the eye, he registered the presence behind him and splendidly launched a backhanded fist. The tremendous response shattered his opponent's spine, but the rebounding sensation told him that it was something different from the old man.

Looking at it, it was one of the corpses from the battlefield that the old man had flung out from the sunken ground. By the time he realized that he had been successfully duped, it was already too late.

???: [Here you go, getting caught again.]

The body flung over the backhanded fist, and its shoulder got struck from behind. In other words, the vicious old man ――Olbart did not move from the underground; he dove in, but simply leapt to the spot.

The small old man, lightly touching his shoulder, escaped backwards while showing off his fine set of teeth.

He merely touched. Neither struck nor slashed. Is he just playing around? Or insulting? ――No, Olbart does not do things without meaning. There is always a meaning, a meaning, a meaning――.

???: [――Huuh!?]

The moment his thoughts got heated, an even greater heat was combusted on his right shoulder, where he got touched.

Looking at it, Olbart's strikingly red handprint stuck on his shoulder. The handprint was seeping blood and spewing smoke as it attempted to burn skin, flesh, and bone.

There was no hesitation immediately after he determined that it was poison.

Garfiel opened his mouth wide to bite off the shoulder with the red handprint imprinted on, tearing off the poison eating away at him. The taste of his own poisoned flesh and blood was terrible, and the bone his fangs grazed was in raging pain.

However, the pain is only momentary. The deeply gouged out shoulder wound erupts in a steam of blood, and the wound is restored by the tremendous surge of flesh――.

Olbart: [This might be the best move, but you sure are a reckless one.]

 Garfiel, breathing heavily, is hit squarely in the nose by Olbart's kick.

When Garfiel's head snapped back, his nose was broken, and he was blown off his feet. He tumbled across the rough ground and landed in a heap, his whole body sprawled out in a heap.

If it were not for Garfiel's sturdy neck, the kick could have sent his head flying off in a million pieces.

However, his head and torso remain connected. Slowly lifting his hand, he places it on his broken nose, and with one breath, he puts it back in place. A harsh sound echoes through his nose.

Olbart: […Jeez, being hard to kill is a weapon in its own right. Not in the emotional sense, but in the physical sense. You're too much trouble, you know that?]

Looking at the painful sight, Olbart sighs in exasperation.

Waving his left hand in the air, how many times has this monstrous old man attacked Garfiel with such relentlessness?

At least, the number of times is not enough for the number of fingers of the old monster's one-arm.

Garfiel: [――Shut the fuck up, Old man. This ain’t over.]

Garfiel slowly rises as a strong steam of blood spurts from his shoulder.

With countless scars on his bare upper body, he clashed with the strongest of the empire, with the aftermath of his fierce battle with Kafma Irulux still fresh in his mind, yet his fighting spirit remained unwavering.

Even by the standards of the Empire, many soldiers would recognize his bravery as impressive and admirable, but unfortunately, the man he was facing had nothing to do with such values of a warrior.

Shrugging, Olbart looks at him with a look devoid of admiration in any way.

Olbart: [I can't be bothered with just you, can I? Well, the walls I've been slipping through have more of a weird smell to them. There are some troublesome people out there, you know, and if they don't get back, they're going to be in trouble.]

Garfiel: [Some troublesome people…?]

Olbart: [Listen carefully, can't you hear it? Don't tell me you can't hear better than an old man like me?"

As Olbart puts his hand to his ear, Garfiel realized himself, narrowing his vision. As he listens carefully, he understands what Olbart is talking about.

Indeed, the sound of many, many footsteps, many footsteps with extraordinary power, shaking the earth and trying to repaint the very atmosphere of the battlefield, was felt in his eardrums and on the soles of his feet.

Olbart: [No, you can't be serious. You're too brave to show your vulnerability in front of me.]

A moment later, an explosive thrown by Olbart into the gap explodes on either side of Garfiel's head.

A thunderous boom and red light spread with a searing heat, demonstrating a power that would easily reduce a human being to dust, and Garfiel's figure disappears in the resulting blast of flame.

Olbart: [Well, that's a little――]

And just after Olbart stared into the burning flames.

Garfiel: [Gaaaahhhh!!]

The moment he was swallowed by the explosion, Garfiel rushed towards him shouting, using the flames as a distraction.

He imagined that if he showed an opening, Olbart would make a move. He did not know what exactly he was plotting, but he won the bet.

Garfiel's arms closed in on Olbart, who was blinded by his own attack, and――,

Olbart: [You’re young, greenhorn.]

As his outstretched arms were crushed, the surprised Garfiel's jaw was kicked straight up from below. The jumping Olbart's foot stamped on his leaping face.

Olbart stood on Garfiel's upwards-looking face with one leg, and in that position, the vicious old man looked off into the distance, as if to tease him.

Olbart: [The troops Kafma pulled back’ll be enough ta defend this place …No one will get out of here without ya.]

With this deliberate statement, Olbart declared his intent to no longer continue this battle.

With bloodshot eyes, Garfiel raised his arms despite the broken elbows, and tried to crush Olbart's minuscule frame atop his face. But Olbart jumped just in time to avoid both arms; during his flip, the right sleeve of the Vicious Old Man fluttered in the wind.

Olbart: [As expected, ya wouldn't die even if yer head flew off, would ya?]

Following this cold death sentence, Garfiel felt the sensation of a drawn blade running down his spine, so he put all his strength into his neck muscles and leaped off this spot to――,

???: [――The chest.]

The next moment, guided by the voice he heard, he selflessly clenched his fists together in front of his chest.

"Nu," a hoarse voice faintly groaned, followed by a chain of destructive sounds of steel being shattered.

Instead of the joined fists in front of his chest, it was the thrusting blade that was shattered ――Garfiel's front, Olbart's unleashed thrust through the heart, was a hidden blade replacing his lost right arm.

With the tip of the blade shallowly buried in his chest, Garfiel's body fell backward.

If he had been even slightly slower to react, Garfiel's heart would have been ripped out, undoubtedly taking his life. No matter how much he could regenerate, even he could not replace a missing heart.

If he had not followed the advice to keep a guard over his neck, he would have died.

Even though he knew that――,

Garfiel: […Fuck off.]

???: [Oh, that is so disheaaartening~ to hear. I thought I'd at least get to hear some words of thanks.]

As Garfiel clicked his tongue, his back was being supported by someone standing behind him.

When he entrusted his weight to him, he felt a hint of a wry smile coming from his aide's hands. Feeling even more annoyed from this, Garfiel's nose wrinkled up.

In general, Garfiel was not good at hating people, but in front of him was Olbart, who belonged to the types of people he hated. However, the person he unmistakably despised the most was standing right behind him.

Being caught in between two hated people, this was the worst possible situation for Garfiel.

Garfiel: [After I crush tha old man, you're next…]

???: [This finally carries taking things out on me to extremes, doesn't it? In a way, isn’t me being the one coming here a stroke of luck? You wouldn't want Ram to see you in this state, would you?]

Garfiel: [Gah…]

Garfiel's throat growled frailly as a nerve was struck.

Garfiel's aide behind him chuckled at his reaction. Olbart, whose hidden blade had been shattered, watched this back and forth from a short distance away.

Olbart: [Just let me tell ya that you're going ta die if ya come this way from tha line on tha ground over there.]

???: [Pardon me, old man. I didn't quite catch that point. After all, I came from the sky.]

Olbart: [From tha sky, ya say?]

Glancing skyward, Olbart closed one eye.

Even his seemingly lethargic appearance was just part of the Vicious Old Man's trickery to lead his opponents around by the nose. Garfiel exhaled as he restrained himself from inadvertently leaping forward.

He pulled the tip of the blade out of his chest, filling in the wound as he did so.

Garfiel: [If you're here…]

???: [Ram is on a different battlefield. I told her to back off, but she didn't listen.]

Garfiel: […To no one's surprise. And ya went out of yer way to come here.]

???: [Of course, I also intend to be somewhat useful. You should consider yourself fortunate.]

As he says this, the duo set their gaze upon the troublesome "Vicious Old Man," and the man with an unfamiliar face was no longer behind Garfield, but next to him ――Roswaal L. Mathers did not have his usual make-up applied, and his blue eye was closed to hide his identity.

Roswaal: [――Because I, too, had once killed a Shinobi.]

He stated this with a deeply vicious smile rivaling his enemies.

――The moment the light was released, its power imbued with a will, Emilia had a vision of her own "death."

Her competitive spirit was strong, and she must not lose hope under any circumstances.

For Emilia, who had funneled power into her abdomen with that attitude, it had been a devastating thing.

Emilia: [――ah.]

In her head, a little Emilia was screaming that she needed to move immediately.

However, her body would not respond with which way she should move, right or left. Even though she would usually move without thinking, she could not do it.

The reason for that was that her heart, not her head, had immediately sensed that right or left, forward or backward, there was no place to escape.

Emilia: [Icicle Line.]

So, instead of running away, Emilia had chosen to defend against it――No, to deflect it.

Creating a thick wall of ice in front of herself and letting the light slide over its slanted surface. Whether or not she could do it, it would be done with the conviction that she could.

When the dragon's breath had been released from the sky in Guaral, Emilia had immediately chosen the same defense. However, that time, Priscilla was there and had managed to cut through and clear away the light that Emilia had weakened a little with the red treasured sword she had.

This time Priscilla was not there. Emilia was alone.

She did not know if she could do the same thing. However, she needed to do the same thing.

Emilia: [Me, and the people behind me――]

At a glance, Emilia knew that there was no chance that the power of the light that had been released would blow only her away.

Earlier, the same kind of light had been released in the distance, and this one resembled that. The light would surely mow down the battlefield and destroy everything.

So――,

Emilia: [――Do your best, me.]

She braced her legs, created a wall of ice in front of her body, and tightly squeezed the ice sword in her hand.

She had created the ice sword because Priscilla had used her treasured sword to cut through the breath. This ice sword did not have the same power as that treasured sword, but it had been for luck.

That, Emilia's all-encompassing bracing――,

Mezoreia: [Disappear, human――]

A breath was released, and white light poured down, closing in on Emilia.

That the voice had come forth from Mezoreia's throat, and the lucidity of the anger in its eyes, in that moment, she forgot all of it. She forgot, and braced herself.

And then, the moment when that breath obliterated the wall of ice, swallowing even Emilia――,

Emilia: [――Eh? ]

After trying to align her ice sword with the light, Emilia’s eyes widened in surprise.

The light that was emitted would have caught Emilia――but instead, it had just slightly veered off to the side. Even so, an enormous shockwave had been produced, almost tearing off Emilia's silver hair and clothes.

While bracing and enduring that, Emilia looked at Mezoreia to see what had happened.

Mezoreia had released a breath, but its head was turned diagonally upward.

It was not that it had changed its mind right before it happened. The orientation of its neck had been forcibly changed. ――By the impact of the Flying Winged Blade, the deadly weapon that had struck it in the face from the side.

Emilia: [That has to be the one that I hurled over there…]

It was Madelyn's weapon of choice, the Flying Winged Blade, which Emilia had accidentally hurled far away when she had tried to throw it back at her.

It had slammed into Mezoreia’s face. “No way,” Emilia said, her eyes widening.

Emilia: [Could it be, I threw it, and now it came back?]

???: [Hahahahaha! That’s a really dreamy and wonderful thing to imagine! But unfortunately, no! It was stuck over there, so I just kicked it off!]

Emilia: [Kyaa!?]

Having imagined a miraculous coincidence, Emilia was greatly surprised by the voice of her smooth-talking companion.

When Emilia turned around flustered, the owner of the voice was crouching down right beside her, staring at the ice sword in Emilia's hand.

???: [This is wonderful with quite beautiful craftsmanship. I've been thinking that if it’s for carrying around with me, a legendary sword would be appropriate, but if it's just for looks, I'd want to put this on my list of candidates.]

Emilia: [Uhh, thanks?]

???: [No, no, if anyone should say thank you, then please let it be me.]

The person to whom that voice belonged――a boy with blue hair tied back――smiled at Emilia, who had not expected to be praised in such a situation, and reflexively thanked him.

He straightened his bent knees and stood up there,

Blue-Haired Boy: [A white and red light divided the blue sky! I was wondering which way to go, but when I came rushing in, I found a big dragon and a beautiful woman waiting for me! As expected of me! I'm too lucky, don't you think?]

Emilia: [Uhh?]

Blue-Haired Boy: [I’m too lucky, don't you think!]

After being asked once more by those sparkling eyes, Emilia felt compelled to answer, and replied, "I think you’re reaaally lucky.”

At Emilia's answer, the boy's smile deepened into a satisfied smirk.

Blue-Haired Boy: [Right!]

Saying that, he took a step forward from beside Emilia, into the sight of the "Cloud Dragon."

Emilia hesitated in saying, “that’s dangerous,” and trying to stop him. It was a sense of pressure. But it was not caused by the giant dragon, but by the small back in front of her.

Because of what that out-of-place, cheerful boy had caused――,

Blue-Haired Boy: [The grand stage has come around! Come on, everyone, watch! Don't blink and miss the big moment of the “Blue Lightning” Cecilus Segmunt, or you'll regret it for the rest of your life――!]

Not taking even a single step back in the face of the transcendent dragon, the boy–Cecilus Segmunt thus loudly and majestically proclaimed.
