*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Abel's black eyes narrowed behind his Oni mask at the sound of the words "Great Disaster."

The person responsible for this utterance, Ubilk, had a smile on his face and did not reveal the depths of his heart.

He was a gentle and affable man who treated everyone equally. His attitude and entire being had not changed since he first appeared before Abel.

This was nothing like the time that he appeared in the audience chamber out of the blue, without any collaborators, or a shred of concern.

As the so-called Stargazer, Ubilk correctly predicted disasters that would befall the Vollachian Empire one after another, and no matter what events he foresaw, his own feelings never wavered at all.

Almost like――,

Abel: [――Is confronting me here just another event you anticipated ?]

Ubilk: [Oh, no. Not at all. You’re giving me way too much credit. I’m faaar~ from being such a big deal.]

Abel: [If all you have to say is nonsense, I will gladly cut out your tongue.]

Ubilk: [Ohhh~ dear, I'm so, so scared. What a stomach-turning thought, as usual.]

While shrugging his slender shoulders, Ubilk boasted this while completely unfazed. When Abel sniffed at this attitude, Serena, who was standing next to him, said, "I don't get it.”

She raised her hands while comparing Ubilk's profile with Abel's.

Serena: [I've seen you before. The Stargazer strolling in and out of the Crystal Palace… You must be one of the jesters that His Excellency the Emperor keeps at his side. Are you acquainted with him, Abel?]

Abel: [Irredeemable​ so.]

Serena: [Hmm. …I didn't mean to ruffle your feathers until all of this was over, but I can't help but ask: Whoever might be hiding his face behind this Oni mask?]

As Serena wondered about Abel's identity, a ray of rationality dwelled within her slitted eyes.

She must have harbored some serious suspicions about this from the very beginning. About this person who successfully assumed the commanding position of the rebel forces amidst this great civil war shaking the Empire―― including the fact that he kept his true face hidden. He was more than a match for Ubilk in the sense of not being able to have his mind read.

However――,

Abel: [Answering that question is not a priority right now.]

Serena: [There are means to remove that mask by force. I am also quite confident in my abilities in that regard.]

Abel: [Let it be. Consider this a warning.]

Serena: [Oh, you're warning me?]

At Abel's words, Serena slowly narrowed her eyes belligerently.

Serena Dracroy, giving free rein to what earned her the moniker of the Scorching Lady with a fierce stance, made it to this point because she had burned down all the scorn and provocations hurled at her.

Due to her creed, Abel's answer was more than enough to inflame tensions.

Ubilk: [Wait, wait, waaait~! Let's calm down a bit! How, how, how can you create such a tense atmosphere just by showing your face like this?]

Abel: [If you keep quiet and watch, you may contribute your fair share to this battle without lifting a finger.]

Ubilk: [Oh, Idon't wish for such a thing. I would hate to have one, or even both of you bite the dust here. Imagine if I~ would be the one to set it all into motion!]

Serena. [――I don't get it.]

As the two were at each other's throats, Ubilk raised a relatively flustered voice as he reached out to both of them. At Ubilk's reaction, Serena had the same response again.

Immediately after, she closed one eye as she played with the sword at her waist.

Serena: [If you graciously stand by the side of His Excellency the Emperor Vincent Vollachia, your duty should be to attack me and this man commanding the rebel forces. If you stay put, this man is as good as dead. Shouldn't this be welcome for you?]

Abel: [Who gave you permission to kill me? You can go ahead and die yourself.]

Serena: [I'm sorry, but I'm talking to this Stargazer right now. Please don't interrupt our conversation.]

Abel: [――――]

As Serena pushed her own subject, she stopped Abel from cutting in for the time being. When Serena looked at Ubilk again, he said with a blank expression,

Ubilk: [Even though it was somewhat necessary, watching from the side was quite the interesting and intriguing spectacle. And please don't make such a scary face. I'm unarmed, after all.]

Serena: [Being unarmed is no reason to let our guard down. Go ahead and give me a reason to remove my hand from the hilt of my sword. Just to let you know, I do not hesitate to cut an unarmed opponent.]

Ubilk: [――I can't be cut down. By you, at least.]

Serena's tone became gradually harsher, and at the end, her words became a threat. Ubilk, who had been looking out of breath up until now, instantly denied it.

The moment he said that, the color faded from Ubilk's expression.

Even if the whole picture of those emotions cannot be seen, the intent behind these emotions he wanted to display faded away, leaving behind a merely blank, empty, and colorless face.

Serena: [――――]

Serena was not incensed by this provocative declaration, and she neither drew her sword.

What weighed on her mind even more than anger was Ubilk's very existence ――No, rather it was this suspicious sense of eeriness and a touch of uneasiness of this being called the Stargazer.

It was as if this person before her very eyes was confronting her, without even responding properly.

Serena: [... We should probably kill you right here and now.]

Ubilk: [Ah, how awful. I’m gravely hurt by this. What do you think?]

Abel: [I often share the same thoughts as Serena Dracroy. However, this man has survived to this day. That's a fact.]

To remain indifferent to everyone means to never know when you tread on someone's toes.

Ubilk, with his complete inability to adapt on the fly, trode on the toes of many in the Vollachian Empire, incurring the wrath of countless people, and sometimes even had a blade pointed at him.

Despite all of this, Ubilk had survived to this day――、

Ubilk: [It is the will of the stars. Oh, Ubilk... it's too early to die yet, way too early.]

Serena clasped her hands together in front of her chest and her cheeks hardened at the light-hearted way Ubilk said this.

There was no point in debating whether that was true or not. The fact Ubilk appeared here―― No, it was like that from the very moment he originally appeared at the Crystal Palace.

Ubilk did not die.

The stars he spoke of made a mockery of life―― The very world itself, it was as if he was saying that he was guaranteed to be under the protection of the Observers.

Abel: [――――]

In the middle of this thought, Abel exhaled as he was silenced by the feeling of a heated assertion.

Abel's personal feelings towards Ubilk and the other Stargazers were trivial. What was important was that Ubilk appeared before Abel's eyes.

This clown, who was coordinating the stars during every possible scenario, appeared in front of Abel――,

Ubilk: [You stepped off the stage once before; or rather, it is more appropriate to say that you were forced to, but you plan to rise up once again?]

Ubilk's gaze turned to Abel, completely ignoring Serena.

Unsure what to make of these words, Serena frowned her well-shaped eyebrows. But, Abel had no intention of responding to her neither in a kind nor thorough manner.

Above all, that question was truly infuriating for Abel.

Abel: [I shall tell you something.]

Ubilk: [Yes?]

Abel: [I never had any intention to step off the stage even once, as you call it.]

Folding his arms, he started by correcting Ubilk's misconception of his original proposition.

Ousted from his throne and driven far to the east, Abel had been put in dire circumstances on many occasions. However, his will to fight never wavered.

Nor did he forget the role he was supposed to play, nor did he ever think of letting go of it.

Abel: [You cannot comprehend, Stargazer. you who has never once stepped upon the stage.]

Ubilk: [――. A painful thing to hear, isn't it?]

Abel: [Even you should be able to understand this.]

With a series of fitting words and facial expressions, Ubilk attempted to communicate with Abel. However, Ubilk's emotionless words did not convey an understanding of Abel's true intentions.

And, that already seemed to be the limit for Ubilk, as Abel had already dismissed it.

For that reason――,

Abel: [The time is near. That is probably why you have traveled here.]

Ubilk: [...Indeed, but you already knew I was coming, didn't you?]

Abel: [Nonsense. I am nothing like you. I may speculate a second ahead of time, but I am not certain. ――Blind acceptance might be a more fitting way to describe it.]

Ubilk: [――――]

At Abel's comment, Ubilk's expression changed slightly.

The slight quiver of his eyebrows was derived from his seldom displayed negative emotions. Anger or discomfort, either way, it was nothing short of a rare response.

Unfortunately, there was no such thing as a calm satisfaction to be found in Abel's mind.

Abel: [What a predicament, you must be at His Excellency's side one way or the other. Shall I send your decapitated head?]

Ubilk: [The Emperor wouldn't even bat an eye. If anything, he would be a bit aggravated that he didn't issue the order himself, but that would be the end of it. More importantly.]

Abel: [More importantly?]

Even though Serena did not understand the details of the dialogue between Abel and Ubilk, she nodded her head as she saw it heading towards a conclusion.

Abel briefly paused as he saw her wavy brown hair sway over her shoulders in the corner of his eye.

And then, he declared.

Abel: [I leave you with a great role to play. ――A role that no one but you can fulfill on this battlefield.]

△▼△▼△▼△

Kicking off the white snow that had piled up, a shadow raced incessantly across the battlefield.

The thin icy ground was slippery all over the place, the lingering temperature was so exceedingly cold that it seemingly cut through one's skin, and an enemy looming from above who was so formidable that it paralyzed your instincts; kicking all away these various circumstances he swept through with lightning speed.

Mezoreia: [You, you, you--]

Cecilus: [Ahahahaha! Instead of "you" you should call me Cecilus Segmunt! You are more than welcome to address me so boisterously that you echo all over the battlefield…]

Mezoreia: [Cecilus Segmunt--!!]

Cecilus: "Yes, that's it!"

Leaving behind a smiling afterimage, the very next moment the soles of his zori pierced the side of Cloud Dragon's face.

With a bursting sound, its head flamboyant​ly bounced back, and Mezoreia's giant body shook wildly in the air. Emilia was surprised how a boy much smaller than her accomplished this.

Emilia: "That boy, is amazing…"

Not only did he stop the dragon's breath that was about to sweep across the battlefield, but also proudly stated what was likely his name as he began to fight the dragon without backing down a single step.

Emilia was captivated by the blue-haired child, who called himself Cecilus.

It was exactly like witnessing him on the grand stage which the boy brazenly spoke off.

Emilia: [----]

Cecilus's body moved in and out of Emilia's vision as if he was a dream or an illusion. Cecilus repeatedly moves in and out, up and down, at the edge of Emilia's field of vision at a tremendous speed.

He was way too fast for Emilia's eyes to keep up, so they started spinning around.

And it is the same for Mezoreia, whom Cecilus coiled around.

Mezoreia: [--Hk! You’re! This Dragon’s! This Dragon’s enemy!]

Flapping its wing in the air, the claws and tail of the Cloud Dragon swung around uncharacteristically excessive.

This was directed at Cecilus, who cheerfully jumped around on a wall of ice that Emilia had built to keep Mezoreia from leaving the battlefield.

However, the dragon's attacks merely hit spots Cecilus had already moved past, crucially leaving him unscathed.

On the contrary, as soon as Mezoreia's tail hit the wall, Cecilus jumped on it and ran up onto its back in one fluid motion.

Cecilus: [Go, go, go, go, go!]

With a swift kick, as if he had several legs, he sent Mezoreia to the ground.

Cecilus: [And, down you go…!]

Flapping its wings violently, Mezoreia was flipped over in mid-air and crashed to the ground.

After a terrific roar and tremor, the snow-covered ground was torn away and scattered, and Emilia, while being showered with cold wind, was almost overcome by the spectacle.

But admittedly, this was a ridiculously lucky situation she could not miss out on.

Emilia: [At this rate, we can defeat Mezoreia…]

Cecilus: [Oops, that won't do. You have to hold that off.]

Emilia: [Huh?]

Though she thought it was a bit unfair, Emilia honed the mana around her and tried to drop a large block of ice on top of the fallen Mezoreia.

But when Emilia was about to do so, Cecilus slipped in front of her and stuck his finger on the tip of her nose; surprised by the action, she stopped moving.

Cecilus, having quickly poked Emilia’s nose, making her blink in surprise,

Cecilus: [Is that okay? Just now, I narrowly saved you from a dangerous situation, didn't I? And now the one-on-one battle with the dragon that has begun...You know what you have to do here, don't you? Yes, you should believe in my victory and bravely pray for me! That's what a princess is supposed to do.]

Emilia: [Umm…But I'm not a princess, okay? I’m not related to a king.]

Cecilus: ["Princess" is a figure of speech. More precisely, it’s the flower of the story who falls madly in love with me, the hero who rescued her. The perfect role for your beautiful self, don't you think?]

Emilia: [Ah, I’m sorry. I've already decided who I'm going to fall in love with.]

Cecilus: [Ah, is that so? Then, there’s no helping it. Please continue.]

Despite being incessantly spoken to at a staggering pace, Emilia had not missed anything that she should not have.  Accordingly, Cecilus also immediately understood and backed away.

Since he had pulled back, Emilia once again raised her hand over head against Mezoreia.

Emilia: [Hiyah―!]

And with that, a giant block of ice fell at full speed from the sky, aimed at Mezoreia who had fallen to the ground.

A thunderous roar echoed after it stabbed Mezoreia’s belly, who had been lying face-up on the ground. While hearing the Dragon’s low cries of pain, Emilia readied the next one, saying “One more time,”

Cecilus: [Excuse me.]

Right after that, Emilia, who braced herself, had her legs swept out from under her, and as she screamed “Auh―,” her body was softly lifted up and withdrawn with a momentum that seemed to pull her out of that place.

The next moment, a strong wind whipped up where Emilia and Cecilus had been, and the impact the Dragon had caused along the ground had bored cylindrically through all the earth in that spot.

If she had been any slower in moving aside, she would have died.

Cecilus: [As expected, It’s not straightforward when the opponent is a Dragon, and a chance to show off comes every second. This is perfect, since my frustration has been accumulating with all the effortless opponents recently.]

Emilia: [T-thank you, for saving me.]

Cecilus: [No, no, don't worry about it! If there's a beautiful woman who already has feelings for someone, it just means changing how you charm them. Please invite me to the wedding!]

Cecilus, who had picked her up and saved her in the nick of time, gave a broad smile at Emilia’s thanks

Strictly speaking, it was not a person she had feelings for, but someone she might end up having feelings for, but she did not have the leeway to go into that in detail right now. What was important was――,

Emilia: [Use them, Cecilus!]

Cecilus: [Use them? Even if I’m told that, I don't know what I'd use...Ohh!]

Having tilted his head, Cecilus’s eyes sparkled when Emilia, who had been lowered to the ground, placed her hands on the ground.

Ice Brand Arts, which created weapons out of ice, spread a line of weapons in front of Cecilus all the way to Mezoreia.

Cecilus: [This is quite spectacular! I like it, it's cool! To tell you the truth, I only wanted to hold in my hands a suitably excellent legendary sword or magical sword of some kind, but...]

Emilia: [Then are these no good?]

Cecilus: [No, it’s not like I’m telling anyone I had that rule, so let’s secretly change it! In this scene, it would be more flashy to wield a weapon against a Dragon!]

While saying that, Cecilus stretched his small body’s arms as far as he could and pulled out the two ice swords on either side of him. As soon as he did so, Emilia realized her mistake with an “Ah.”

The ice sword was made by Emilia. Therefore, Emilia would not feel the cold, but it might be too cold for Cecilus who had not.

Emilia: [Come to think of it, Priscilla never said it was cold either, but...]

Cecilus: [Don’t worry.  I can make up for the inconvenience of the circumstances with the Flow Method, so both myself and the people in the battalion are fine. Well, since I don't do well when I’m dragged into that stuff with Boss and the others, it’s true that I’m especially special for handling it naturally!]

Emilia: [Spehcial...]

As unfamiliar words were let out one after another, Emilia unconsciously pondered.

This unnatural sensation reminded Emilia of talking to Subaru, and when she thought about it, she realized, "Maybe."

Emilia: [Hey, Cecilus! Did you learn those words from Subaru?]

Cecilus: [Are you Subaru-san? Nope, sorry, but you're not. It was my boss who taught me this kind of language, but his name was not Subaru-san.]

Emilia: [Yeah, you're right, they're not… I guess I made a hasty mistake.]

Despite her forwardness, Emilia was disheartened by Cecilus' answer. However, not wanting to be discouraged, Emilia quickly slapped herself on the cheek to compose herself.

Then, like Cecilus, she picked up the ice spear herself.

Emilia: [I’ve changed my mind… Let’s fight Mezoreia together!]

Cecilus: [That's a really nice change of heart. Come to think of it; I haven't even heard your name yet.]

Emilia: [Me? I am Emilia… No, it’s, Emily! Emily!]

Cecilus: [I see you have your reasons! But I think it's best if I don't say anything inappropriate here, so that's just what I'm going to do, Emily-san. May I ask you for one of those?]

Emilia: [A request? Of me?]

Cecilus: [Yes. ――When you are in the middle of dealing with that Dragon, could I ask you to move that thing out of the way?]

Cecilus asked Emilia, having exchanged names, to do something for him in a hushed voice. Having said this, he pointed to the ground a short distance away from Mezoreia, who had fallen to the ground.

Seeing Cecilus' finger pointing at the snowy ground, Emilia's eyes widen with an "ah."

And then――,

Cecilus: [Then please do, Emily-san. I’ll do my work… I’ll do something that only a flamboyant actor of this world can do!]

After saying this, Cecilus kicked off the ground without waiting for Emilia's reply.

The snow scattered, and Cecilus' body, gripping two ice swords, ran straight for the dragon. Mezoreia’s scales instantly sensed the danger of the small threat rushing at her.

Mezoreia: [Don’t get carried away――!]

A shuddering rage rose up, and Mezoreia clawed at the block of ice that was about to crush her torso. In an instant, the gigantic mass of ice as large as a small mountain could not withstand it for even a second. Cracks ran through its entirety with tremendous force, breaking it all at once.

Once the weight of the ice block was gone, Mezoreia immediately rolled over and fell to the ground, ready to unleash an attack on the driving Cecilus――,

Emilia: [Hiyah!!]

The spear thrown by Emilia, swung at Mezoreia, struck her squarely on the nose.

The sharp ice spear did not bury a sliver of its tip into Mezoreia's scales, but with the force of its impact, it repelled the dragon's head and delayed her attack on Cecilus.

Then Cecilus jumped in at a speed that nearly matched the thrown spear.

Cecilus: [Attention please, your applause, if you blink you will miss it!]

Cecilus's ice twin swords burst out with white light as he spoke lightly.

With an easy sound, the "Sky Dragon" was struck through the scales and bounced to the right and left, blinded by the sword dance, deprived of its freedom, and deprived of the opportunity to counterattack.

Even though he was still small, Cecilus had an unthinkable level of skill. 

In both the way she used her body and handled her weapon, Emilia thought that she had become quite proficient herself, but Cecilus had reached a dimension beyond comparison. Perhaps he even had the potential to become as absurdly strong as Reid, who she had happened to meet at the Pleiades Watchtower. 

Emilia: [Though, please don’t become as malicious as Reid.]

Setting aside his ability with the sword, Reid was terribly malicious, so she hoped that Cecilus’s personality would not become like that.

With this wish in mind, Emilia rushed to a point a short distance away from the battle, with Cecilus at her side to attract Mezoreia.

The object of the request Cecilus made to Emilia earlier was coming closer and closer.

Emilia rushed to the destination, and there she found――,

Emilia: [――Madelyn! This is no time to sleep! Wake up and persuade Mezoreia!]

Emilia held up Madelyn Eschart's body, which was buried in the snow and not moving a muscle, and called out desperately to her.
