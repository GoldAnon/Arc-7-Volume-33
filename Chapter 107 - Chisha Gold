The oni mask did not obscure just how the man's face stiffened as he was pushed away.

An expression of that sort would easily lend itself to misinterpretations. Despite his cleverness, or perhaps because of it, the Emperor would often abridge his statements, even when unfavorable; and his countenance was no less taciturn than his mouth.

If there was somebody able to seize the truth behind that expression, it was probably himself, who had spent several years at the Emperor's side.

Chisha: [Or, perhaps――]

Were it the Emperor's little sister, whom he held sacred in every sense of the word, at this place, would she figure it out as well?

In any case, it was pointless to make comparisons now.

After all, in this minuscule, isolated place in time and space, nobody was present other than himself.

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [Chesha Trim, would you be willing to die for my sake?]

Upon their first meeting, having disclosed his name, he received a question treating matters of life and death in exchange.

Chesha, fourteen years old at the time, had believed himself to be mature for his age, but meeting that boy, two years younger than himself, forced him to reconsider.

What the youngster before his eyes exhibited was true maturity, whereas his own case was mere conceit.

???: [――――]

Once the question came out, the boy awaited with his black eyes fixed on him.

His hair and irises, both black as if imbued with shadows, were considered uncommon traits, even in a land so rich in racial diversity like the Vollachian Empire. Although Chesha's eye color differed, he likewise had been born with black hair. For that, he would often become the subject of mockery, so he could sympathize with the boy.

Or maybe not. It felt nothing short of insolent to think that they shared something to sympathize over.

Physical characteristics, however rare they may be, amounted to trifles when compared with what actually made the boy especial. Superficial coincidences aside, the child's very origins elevated him far from ordinary folks, and that refined, precocious attitude was also a product of his upbringing.

He stood in a unique position, where he must grow this way, lest he would not survive.

To be precise――,

Chesha: [――Prince Vincent Abellux.]

His name was accompanied by a title, his role acquired at birth.

This black-haired youngster, Vincent, was the son of Drizen Vollachia, sovereign of the Vollachian Empire, and therefore one of several children bestowed with the possibility to one day stand at the pinnacle of the Empire.

He had more than twenty siblings possessed of similar qualifications, but that did not devalue his noble blood in the slightest.

Regardless――,

Chesha: [――――]

Chesha reminisced on his course of action heretofore, seeking to solve one doubt: how had he ended up encountering such an outstanding lad, not to mention riding the same carriage as him?

All had begun with a simple act of assistance.

He had come across a stranded carriage, its wheel stuck in a ditch on the highway. Pushing and pulling, many attempts were being made in vain to release it. He approached the scene and freed the lurched carriage from the deep ditch by inserting a board and utilizing it as a lever.

Much to his surprise, that vehicle belonged to the lord of the Abellux Domain, and aboard sat that individual famous for his rise to headship through the Miracle of Abellux, Vincent Abellux himself.

“Miracle of Abellux” was the name given to a rebellion that had begun with a vassal of the House of Abellux betraying their long-lasting patronage by conspiring with another family. But albeit their tactics had been brilliant, they had suffered defeat at the hands of an eleven-year-old commander. In the end, all conspirators had been massacred.

His household's members and soldiers having given in to distress and disarray, Vincent, whose name remained unsung back then despite his princely status, had devised a plan for them without delay. By exercising his prodigious finesse, he had thus achieved victory.

The vassal behind the rebellion had underestimated Vincent as an enemy, judging him to be an easy prey whom they could behead for a trophy. Those presumptuous delusions had become the cause of their demise.

Facts came to light, as did apocryphal rumors, giving him quite the outrageous reputation.

As a civilian of the Empire, Chesha heard the stories as well, but he had never pondered the odds of getting involved with him―― yet here he was, by a twist of fate, in front of the person dreaded by the public.

And then, that had been cast towards him. ――If he was willing to die for him or not.

Chesha: [――――]

Whatever had he aimed to earn with that inquiry, Chesha could not discern.

In the first place, he had been invited aboard for two reasons: to thank him for releasing the wheel, and to bring him into the mansion.

Of course, Chesha held not the right to decline. No matter how much he resented this, his opinion carried nonexistent weight.

Hence, he had resigned a fraction of his time and stepped into the carriage. Once he had set foot onto the vehicle, Vincent had begun the interrogation.

It was inappropriate to start that interaction with an acquaintance who only helped him resume his journey. But this boy was a prince by birth, thereby accustomed to having people heed his wishes.

Notwithstanding, he bore a relatively recent record of annihilating an entire family and its retainers, out of fury towards the vassal who had committed treachery against him. Nobody would blame a twelve-year-old for developing an extreme distrust of people after an experience of that ilk.

Perhaps his mind would not be at ease unless he managed to confirm everybody's allegiance, even that of a casual passerby.

The silence had already extended for ten-odd seconds, more than enough for it to turn disrespectful.

The issue at hand concerned a figure not simply superior, but supreme. Still, he understood what answer he ought to give, and what answer the other wanted.

Obviously, the other wished to hear a single phrase, “I would”.

This was a test for Chesha, as a citizen of the Empire. Either he pledged unwavering loyalty and eternal servitude to the prince, or he would incur the forenamed's wrath, knowing that within him, potentially, lay the seed of a tyrant.

Enduring the improper distance between them, Chesha bowed his head deeply before the possible sovereign――,

Chesha: [――My apologies, but I am afraid I would not.]

And so, he spoke the one reply that he should have avoided.

Chesha: [――――]

His head still lowered, Chesha cursed himself for committing such a gaffe on impulse. Moreover, he felt the urge to grab his own head in embarrassment at his lack of self-control.

With his impatient nature as the reason, he had gotten in trouble with a powerful individual and ended up banished from his hometown. Time after time he would tell himself that his behavior could ruin his prospects, yet he had never been able to mend it.

And at last, he had addressed the worst possible answer to the worst possible addressee.

He would soon perish in one of the most stupid ways: falling victim to his own idiocy.

However, he could not act brazen enough as to give the desired answer in the desired manner to a question about death, much less with the overbearing tone in which it was delivered.

If his heart were to shatter, were his pride to be extinguished, then, as far as he was concerned, even if he still breathed, he was dead too.

He did not cherish Vollachia's praxis, but he was nonetheless a man of the Empire.

Therefore, he held no regrets towards his response.

If anything, he felt sorry for taking his pitiful frustrations out on a boy who had merely sought something that would assuage his own trust issues.

At least, that guilt would disappear once the rageful blade unattached his head from his shoulders――,

Vincent: [Perfect. Maintain that outlook, for you shall be serving me hereafter.]

Chesha: [――. I will?]

Vincent: [Do not end your affirmations in a rising tone. Otherwise, they shall come across as interrogative.]

Chesha: [I did not err, the pronunciation was intentional… So, does this mean you will not execute me?]

Vincent: [Seconds after securing you? That would be senseless.]

Closing one eye, Vincent scowled with a hint of annoyance.

Receiving a meaningless question irritated him, yet he did not protest when denied a vow of loyalty. Chesha found that strange, but he kept his composure and reexamined the situation.

For some reason, Vincent seemed to overlook Chesha's irreverence.

Far from that, he seemed to consider recruiting Chesha as his retainer.

Chesha: [I apologize, but I cannot wrap my head around this. Is it a hobby of yours to jest with those you intend to kill before taking their lives?]

Vincent: [Do tell, why do you insist that I kill you with such obstinacy? That is far more incomprehensible, I dare say.]

Chesha: [I do not mean to offend, but it is well-known that you do not take kindly to those who oppose you.]

By the time he realized that his comment was again of the undue sort, it had already escaped his mouth.

However, since he had succeeded in committing one transgression, Chesha shifted into a bolder stance, ready to find out how many more he could commit before reaching the threshold, putting his life on the line.

Like whenever he enjoyed a book, cultivated new knowledge, or proved his theories through execution, he was determined to decipher the prince's unrevealed thoughts.

If he died in consequence, so be it.

While Chesha surrendered almost his whole future to embark on this reckless undertaking, Vincent, now aware of the context, nodded with an “Ah” before continuing,

Vincent: [If you are referring to the latest rebellion, I made an example of that family because it was necessary. You ought to collar any wight who might be aspiring to attempt the same deed. Fear produces the best effects for that.]

Chesha: [And is that also why you had the instigating servant's advance troops dismembered and put on display on the road?]

Vincent: [If a life must be ended, then you had better exploit it to the utmost first. People should die in an efficient manner.]

So replied Vincent, his chin resting on his hand, as he sat inside the carriage. His austere, realistic perspective left Chesha at a loss for words.

What Chesha had mentioned was the first and main counterattack that Vincent had launched in order to suppress the rebellion―― slaughtering the enemy vanguard, plus the barbarous profanation of their cadavers.

After enduring the anguish of being mangled while alive, their corpses had been lined up within the battlefield. Hearsay had spread that getting caught would result in similar punishment, and thus, the other traitors had chosen to disregard their agreement with the primary conspirator and relegate themselves to the role of spectators.

Alone, bereft of any escape route, said conspirator had gone to confront Vincent, only to end up ensnared in the latter's sanguinary stratagem. They, alongside their relatives and retainers, had perished savoring the same hell that the other soldiers had.

Naturally, with the emergence of this information, the public had reshaped its notion of Vincent Abellux into that of a brutal, bloodthirsty prince. But――,

Chesha: [――Are those rumors of your own creation, perhaps?]

Vincent: [If my sole presence elicits dread in you, I can at least say that their purpose has not gone unfulfilled.]

Chesha: [Hahaaa, good to hear, I guess…]

More and more did Vincent's thoughts sound too impressive for ones that had sprung from a twelve-year-old.

On the other hand, although Vincent had pardoned his irreverence, Chesha did not expect to be capable of performing whatever mission Vincent had in store for him.

Vincent: [What exact purpose do I expect from you, you wonder?]

As if he had read Chesha's mind, Vincent delivered the next question.

It was vaguer than the previous one, and moreover, it required Chesha to unravel the mystery with his own brain. Surely, there was an arduous mission meant for him, but he needed to pinpoint what it entailed.

A very challenging problem, indeed.

Born into the imperial family, Vincent was destined to take part in the Empire's imminent rite sooner or later. What purpose could he find in a mere plebeian like Chesha?

Chesha: [I doubt I can do much more than help you pull a jammed wheel out.]

Vincent: [And that shall benefit me.]

Chesha: [Hoho, I assume you are planning to go get stuck in a ditch quite often from here on out, if you require my strength that much?]

He felt almost inclined to congratulate himself for reaching a new milestone in disrespect with that aggravating quip.

Yet, upon hearing it, no part of Vincent's countenance twitched.

Vincent: [Correct. The road I am traversing is fraught with ditches, and I cannot avoid all of them. However, I cannot stay in a ditch waiting for the issue to solve itself; otherwise, death shall come for me. And that means, I shall need a method to pull myself out whenever I get stuck.]

Chesha: […Before we continue, are you sure this discussion is still about wheels?]

Vincent: [I have not belied the subject once ever since we began talking.]

The bizarre reply made a chill run down Chesha's body, not because he felt threatened, but because he finally assimilated that his conversational partner was a phenomenon.

In addition, the aforementioned phenomenon held him in oddly high regard.

Chesha concluded so from the fact that, despite the irreverent attitude adopted, the rude replies given, the impolite retorts uttered, Vincent appeared uninterested in killing him.

Was that proof of Chesha's merits, or proof of Vincent's principles?

Regardless, he would never have imagined that a day this eventful awaited him upon waking up this morning in his shabby lodging.

Vincent: [――――]

While Chesha remained silent, Vincent looked at him, head poised on his hand, one eye shut.

That gesture gave off the odious impression that he was basking in the satisfaction of shutting his opponent's mouth. Losing all strength to resist, Chesha turned his disgruntled gaze towards Vincent, and arrived at a sudden realization.

Chesha: [I see, you never close both eyes at the same time.]

Vincent: [There you have it.]

Chesha: [Huh?]

Putting a hand to his pointed chin, Vincent replied to Chesha's offhand observation with a nod.

Unable to grasp the meaning of that sentence, Chesha tilted his head.

Vincent: [If you wish to know the reason as to why I did not execute you, therein it lies.]

Vincent's explanation was short, but his mien indicated that he deemed it complete. The moment Chesha noticed that, everything fell into place.

The precocious boy put many adults to shame with the schemes that he concocted, and with the unbridled way he wielded his talent as prince of Vollachia, yet nonetheless he was twelve years of age.

――If he were not, he would have already learned how naive it was to expect those around him to possess wisdom matching his own.

△▼△▼△▼△
――Chisha Gold.

That was the new name conferred on Chesha Trim upon entering the Abellux estate as Vincent's recruit.

Chisha: [Since my family is back at my hometown, I would rather keep my name from becoming well-known to avoid causing them unwarranted trouble. Though, I suppose you would find it easy to murder all my worries away…]

Vincent: [You seem very obstinate in portraying me as a bloodthirsty brute. Are you also responsible for the sobriquet of Sanguinary Prince that people call me in the streets, perchance?]

Chisha: [Why, I believed that was another one of your fear-based strategies. I have heard accounts about parents mentioning you in cautionary tales for children, as in, “Behave, or else the Sanguinary Prince will come.”]

Vincent: [Come, but for what purpose, according to them? As if I would bother.]

Chisha: [Oh, but what if you show up and hire them against their will, like you did to me? Pretty frightening, if you ask me.]

Vincent: [I advise you to watch your tongue, or I might end up justifying those fabrications with your blood.]

Conversations with Vincent blurred the line between seriousness and jest.

Should the need arise, Vincent would pay with somebody else's life, no hesitation. He would never do that if unnecessary, though. He handled human lives the same way he handled money or goods.

When consorting with him, one could not ignore that he regarded whichever as limited resources with equal value.

The reason for the name change to Chisha Gold matched his statement; he was worried that somebody in his hometown would turn indignant at the news of Chesha Trim's promotion and involve his family in retaliation.

Notwithstanding, even if his family were harmed, he would not go out of his way to help.

Albeit callous in the eyes of some, a certain distance existed between him and his kin, and just with that he was being compassionate enough towards the relatives who had neglected him in the most critical of moments.

Funnily or not, the surname Gold pertained to a family exterminated by Vincent as a punishment for treachery.

Perhaps it had been a little jape of revenge from Vincent towards Chesha's rudeness; but that aside, it misled the public into rumoring that he had spared one descendant of Gold, while condemning them to endure the humiliation of failing to escape his control, which reinforced his standing as the Sanguinary Prince.

As for the first name, Vincent had suggested a single letter modification, so it sounded similar to his original one, just like Chesha had hoped. Since he had had no motive to complain, and no malice seemed to be implicated this time, albeit adjudging it frugal, he had approved the idea.

Despite everything, after a lifetime of being ostracized for his proclivity to theory over practice and for his social clumsiness, Chesha's rebirth as Chisha brought a welcome change.

Never could his remote village have provided him with so many books and activities to indulge in.

He had gotten the opportunity to resettle, far from those who had unjustly scorned him for being inept at tilling or harvesting the fields, and he would never trade that for anything in the world.

However――,

Vincent: [We are in the next ditch, Chisha. Prove your utility.]

Every time, those words warned him that Vincent was about to harass him over a problem leagues above stuck carriage wheels, initiating a discussion that would persist until a solution sprang.

Vincent's drive made him a force to be reckoned with.

In what way did Vincent view and perceive the world, tackling various issues at the same time, with consistent focus as well, despite bearing two eyes and one head like ordinary men?

Sure enough, a lord held the duty to involve himself in his domain's matters, but it was an unscrupulous thing to anticipate from a twelve-year-old, even more so when he lacked adult figures to rely on.

But any commiserations that an outsider might direct at Vincent would disperse upon being faced with his performance.

Being associated with Vincent demanded a vast array of specialized knowledge from Chisha, which granted him no time to loiter.

As soon as they solved an issue, a new one appeared; sometimes, another issue would surge while the current one was still at hand. And while he racked his brains over those different problems at once, the Abellux Domain continued evolving.

The quality of life improved, while the residents' initial apprehension transformed into commendation.

Vincent had the ability to turn terror into admiration and servitude into adoration, both well deserved.

He did not bother with others' opinions of himself, and therein lay the reason for which he held that aforementioned ability.

Vincent: [Chisha, you have educated yourself well on the flood control system. Now, I must discharge that incompetent administrator from his post. I shall adduce his charges of embezzlement heretofore and have him decapitated.]

Chisha: [In my humble opinion, such charges do not warrant a decapitation.]

Vincent: [So, he earned his profits due to effort? Is that what you are telling me?]

Chisha: […This topic is a little too far from my specialty.]

Vincent: [If what he has pocketed were offset by his work, I would ignore him. Otherwise, retribution is due. By refusing to correct his misconduct, even after repeated warnings, he himself depleted the allowances that I conceded.]

Beneath Vincent's drastic initiative and resoluteness hid his fastidious side, contrasting with his expectations towards others and, as an underlying factor, inclining him to criticize those unable to meet them as slothful.

Vincent was no meritocrat, though; he did not disrelish people solely for being incompetent.
Were he to put his own doctrine into words――,

Vincent: [――One ought to perform the vocation that corresponds with their caliber.]

He wished for everybody to live with all their might, no respite.

Knowing this, the boy named Vincent Abellux and the circumstances behind his fastidious perfectionism seemed to start shining in a different light.

Unbelievable as it might sound, Vincent did not possess unwavering confidence, nor did he take pride in himself.

For more, he constantly hungered.

For more, he constantly lamented.

For more, he constantly struggled.

At the core of Vincent's being lay a driving force. It was not gratitude towards the princely status bestowed upon him, but a furious determination to fulfill the role that said status demanded.

And the motive that made Vincent harbor these fierce sentiments was――,

Vincent: [――There is one despicable man, Stride Vollachia his name.]

Some time after joining Vincent, Chisha found himself frowning at the words that his master had spoken.

Luckily, or rather, proving Vincent's discretion accurate, Chisha indeed had somewhat of a talent to pull wheels out of ditches, thanks to which he had managed to not lose his job.

That said, he had been steered down this path little by little.

His position's pros and cons had revealed themselves one after the other, tipping the scales in a way that made it difficult to tell which side weighed more.

And Chisha was still in the process of pondering that, when, for the first time, Vincent exposed something unrelated to work, something stemming from somewhere in his heart.

Chisha: [Stride Vollachia, is it? Pardon my ignorance, my studies must still be insufficient, considering I have never heard that name.]

Vincent: [No, your studies are not to blame. In fact, your life would be at risk if you knew that information. That man's existence has been long erased from the records of the Imperial Family of Vollachia, after all.]

Chisha: [――――]

Chisha thought about how Vincent might have just endangered him by disclosing that so incautiously, but, given his position, it was difficult to interrupt the latter once he had started talking.

Besides, he was interested in that man who had been ousted from the Imperial Family.

Chisha: [Well, ousting someone of the imperial bloodline does not sound possible. Even if it were done, their blood still flows through their veins. Plus, that is what the Imperial Selection Ceremony exists for.]

The Imperial Selection Ceremony, held in order to determine the Empire's next sovereign.
This ceremony, a competition where the Emperor's offspring would kill each other to reach the pinnacle of the Empire, was a prime representation of the nation's essence, with origins dating back to its very founding.

The last one standing would be crowned Emperor.

And as the Emperor of Vollachia, they could seize the Yang Sword, emblem of their reign.

Chisha: [Though, in theory, one can live without fighting if they renounce their right to inherit the throne, or so I have heard.]

Vincent: [A mere prevarication. That is fantasy, naught but a tool to cull beforehand those who, despite possessing the right to power, lack the courage to triumph in the ceremony. And that is to say, your concerns are correct.]

Chisha: [So ousting a member of the Imperial Family is unthinkable.]

Vincent: [Yet, Stride Vollachia suffered that unthinkable penalty, and was therefore disengaged from the ceremony's ensemble. Even so, given that the Imperial Selection Ceremony progressed without delay afterwards, that wight most likely did not elude death.]

Vincent's gaze, colder than usual, was tinged with deep disdain towards the man in question.

Stride Vollachia, the man who had been removed from his position as part of Vollachia's Imperial Family, erased from the historical records―― He was of the exact sort that evoked Vincent's fury.

To those who did not perform their assigned role nor exert their natural abilities to the fullest, he offered zero clemency.

Chisha: […Even so, how come you know of his existence, when no one is supposed to, Vincent-sama? Did a chatty gentleman of high status tell you, perhaps?]

Vincent: [Never afraid to step over the hierarchical ditch with your insolence, are you? ――The journal.]

Chisha: [Journal?]

Vincent: [Yes, Stride Vollachia's journal. It was concealed in the Crystal Palace's library, where I found it. Shame that such an intriguing tome turned out to be full of unreadable, nonsensical inscriptions.]

The way Vincent curled his lips in displeasure was a gesture of unmitigated loathing.

Vincent generally took a tolerant approach when digesting and evaluating things. He went through said thought process with impressive speed, which, for better or for worse, almost made it seem like he judged without prior deliberation. It would strike anybody as unusual to witness that same Vincent displaying such negative emotions.

Chisha: [And what was inscribed in it? Would you ever show it to me?]

The topic piqued his interest.

Nevertheless, deep down, he knew well that his attention was digressing from the journal's contents, towards discovering what put his troublesome master in so much anguish.

Aware of Chisha's inner thoughts or not, Vincent closed one of his black eyes and, piercing him with his gaze, spoke.

Vincent: [I shall not show it to you. ――Not that anthology of worthless delusions about the Observers and things akin.]

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [Deary me, thinking that there's a reason for everything is thinking way too hard. Surprisingly, no one schemes as much as His Excellency and Chesha, with you two’s furrowed brows.]

Chisha: [――I would rather prefer you are careful in the way you speak, my name is Chisha.]

???: [AHHH, I am so sorry! It is the extremity of rudeness to err in an actor's name! I very much regret it… Chisha, Chisha, Chisha, Chisha, Chisha, Chisha, Chisha!]

Chisha: [――――]

With vigor, and well, nothing but vigor really, a blue-haired boy chattered on.

The boy, his name Cecilus Segmunt, had curried Vincent’s favor and thus recruited, just like Chisha had.

If the ability one possessed was of excellence, and if said person were resolute to make optimal use of their skills, they would be appointed to a high position.

Though Vincent's approach, which took neither birth nor status into account, had elicited opposition, the expanse of the Abellux Domain had been continuously growing year upon year.

However, the gulf between educated and uneducated people was large, and albeit Vincent did state that he paid no heed to one’s status, sure enough, it yet remained difficult to gather civil servants of excellence from the commoners. Henceforth, the hardships afflicting Chisha did not abate in number.

However――.

Cecilus: [The only thing a military officer needs is the strength of arms. I believe I should have more flair as an actor upon the stage, and furthermore, because I alone am unique in that respect!]

Chisha: [What considerable self-confidence… You appear to possess the strength to advocate that. That could be said to be somewhat of a nuisance, but that is none of my busineeess.]

The child in high-spirits―― in fact, the child was six or seven year younger than Chisha, who was now eighteen years of age. There had been no error in that description, “a child in high-spirits”, but unfortunately Cecilus really did not have the charm befitting his age.

Not because of his appearance or demeanor, but rather because of the skills he boasted as he laughed.

Chisha: [――――]

Chisha himself had been taken into the Abellux household, having been taught how to fight for both self-defense and to serve as a bodyguard, but he was well-aware that his aptitude in that field was that of an ordinary man. He was more suited to operate a large group of people, versus operating his own body.

But that did not mean that he could neglect his training, which he would need to keep up with for the rest of his life. But even from the viewpoint of someone worthless in the realm of martial arts, Cecilus’s fighting prowess deviated far beyond the norm

Already, Chisha had met the extraordinary in terms of ingenuity.

But he had never expected to come across the extraordinary in terms of armed might alike.

Chisha: [Then, I wonder what Vincent-sama… what His Excellency desires from me all the more.]

Cecilus: [Oh, you're pondering over something again, Chisha. I'll give you the answer. Something flashy. ――It's called foreshadowing!

Cecilus thus thrust his finger, and once he spoke, Chisha widened his eyes.

Seeing Chisha's reaction, Cecilus retracted the finger he had extended, and spoke,

Cecilus: [Perhaps you don’t know what’s foreshadowing? You see, foreshadowing’s the embedding of important information in a narrative in a way that’s unrecognizable…]

Chisha: [I am aware of the definition of the word “foreshadowing”. But my expression is more that I cannot fathom your intent in bringing it up.]

Cecilus: [Ohh, I see! That’s easy then. Didn’t I tell you? You're worried that everything has a meaning, that's what His Excellency and you both have in common.]

A happy smile plastered on his face, Cecilus clapped his hands together in front of his chest. Then, he spread them out, twirling around in place, and indicated everything in his surroundings,

Cecilus: [If all things do truly hold meaning! Then everything that cannot be unraveled at this moment is foreshadowing to be used in future developments! How exciting!]

Chisha: [The flow of unaccounted for funds, the existence of masses of wealth whose owners are unknown are not foreshadowing of the future, but rather evidence of rampant corruption and bribery, would you not think so?]

Cecilus: [That's it! That's the answer you can give me at this point in time! I'm talking about the one you can’t. Chisha, you’ve got a great head, so listen to me properly will you!?]

Chisha: [――――]

Halting his spinning abruptly, Cecilus protested, eyebrows furrowed in anger.

He harbored feelings of dissatisfaction at the reasons for which he was being scolded; however, Chisha felt somewhat saved, only a tiny bit, by Cecilus's thoughts.

Although Vincent had appointed him to a post of great responsability, although he had toiled to meet his demands, in a corner of his mind there had always been a nagging doubt as to why he had been summoned to work for him.

Even after all these years, even after he had gotten to know Vincent's personality, he had always been unable to figure that out.

Because it was not Vincent’s problem, but rather Chisha’s own problem.

Staying at Vincent’s side, without this anguish of his being answered, had been remarkedly draining to his mind――,

Chisha: […So I am inclined to believe that my presence is foreshadowing as well?]

Cecilus: [Ohhh? You’ve made masterful use of it right away, huh? As expected of someone with a good head, so quick to understand! I can’t do the same in any way whatsoever, you have my respect!]

Chisha: [If you say you respect me, should you not use a honorific when referring to me? I am older than you, your superior, and your senior, am I not.]

Cecilus: [That’s no goood. Referring to a friend with “san” is a bit distant, isn’t it? Our relationship’s that of being on the same boat when it comes to the future. Let's not be so stand-offish about it!]

Chisha: [A friend…]

Having been told that in such an unreserved way, having been patted on the shoulder, Chisha was at a loss for words.

The familiarity, the sense of distance between them being closed was one thing, but the biggest reason for that was that he had reflected on himself, coming to realize the fact that he had no companion who he could call a friend.

Having abandoned the village that was his hometown, afterwards being picked up by Vincent, for several years he had foolhardily learned under him, laboring, struggling, yet he had never forged a close relationship with anyone.

Of course, there were people he had a favorable impression of, but that was only superficial.

Chisha: [――――]

Cecilus: [Something wrong? Oh, do you still want be referred to with "san"? I don’t think it’s a bad idea to start off that formally right off the bat, to then gradually close the distance until we’re finally! I also think it’s not a bad idea to switch to the other direction…]

Chisha: [No, that will be enough. ――His Excellency prefers allies who prize haste.]

It was not like he had really followed Cecilus’s drivel, but if he would arrive at the same destination all the same, the sooner the better.

Jesting at his own thoughts, apparently completely stained by Vincent's principles, Chisha not to deny Cecilus's way of thinking, and instead accept it.

If he were to follow his style of speech――,

Chisha: [For the fulfillment of His Excellency’s wishes, I expect you to exhibit your power. As is natural, for you too were picked up by him…]

Cecilus: [I suppose that's foreshadowing for me to be useful in a grand manner! Please leave it to me, Chisha. I may be a novice at everything but doing battle, but when it comes to that, no one can keep up with my level!]

Chisha: [That will do.]

The slender child threw out his chest vigorously, but Chisha did not smile at the grandiose words from the dainty-looking child.

As per Vincent’s assessment, and his own, he bestowed Cecilus Segmunt with the placement befitting his ability.

On top of that――.

Chisha: [――Seems like I cannot do anything but wait for the day when I can function as foreshadowing.]

So did Chisha mutter to himself, conscious of the role his much-younger friend had spoken of.

At that very moment, the Imperial Selection Ceremony, in which Vincent Abellux was to contend, would begin just half a year away.

△▼△▼△▼△

The death of former Emperor Drizen Vollachia and the subsequent start of the Imperial Selection Ceremony.

Because of his indisputable talents, Vincent Abellux was regarded as an enemy by his other siblings, and got caught into a web of concentrated attacks for a time.

However, as it turned out, Vincent lived up to his initial reputation and expectations, winning the Imperial Selection Ceremony with overwhelming strength.

Vincent Abellux, who had vanquished all his siblings and was adorned with the crown of blood of the Vollachian Empire ――No, the 77th Emperor Vincent Vollachia was born.

Part of that bloody path that Vincent walked and the great river of blood that Vincent trenched might be due in part to the contributions of Chisha and Cecilus, who served as his subordinates.

However, in this Imperial Selection Ceremony, making plans for Vincent's victory was not the same as pulling the wheel out of the ditch, which was expected of Chisha.

During this battle, Chisha’s entrusted role was to make the very last move on the board――,

Chisha: [――I see that your younger sister has escaped unharmed. She may have quite the fierce and uninhibited personality, but I am sure she understands her predicament. I think things are settled, for the time being.]

It is in an office, namely a room in the Crystal Palace in Lupugana, the Imperial capital.

In that room used by the Emperor himself, the pinnacle of national politics, Chisha stepped into a situation where a familiar face was looking back at him, a situation that would take him a while to get comfortable with the dealings with a sense of calm.

The emperor himself, though, showed no sign of disturbing his usual manner when he sat on such an authoritative chair. Even when he was assured that his victory in the Imperial Selection Ceremony was unassailable, he did not show even a hint of a smile from a sense of accomplishment.

Vincent did not laugh, at least not while he was a prince or the Emperor.

At moments when he wasn't a prince, he would break character, crack a smile and even show a mischievous grin.

He became the Emperor. And he would not allow for a moment when the Emperor was not the Emperor.

――No, there was one shared moment where that was not the case.

Chisha: [I could not believe my ears when asked for a way to save Prisca-sama.]

Assuming that no one else was listening, Chisha spoke of the greatest secret of the Vollachian Empire, one in which he had participated.

Coinciding with the conclusion of the Imperial Election Ceremony, the birth of a new Emperor was announced.

But the fact of the matter was that the completion of the imperial succession had not been fulfilled in the ceremony in which the last of the imperial family would succeed to the throne. ――The last two remained.

The two were Vincent Abellux and Prisca Benedict.

Prisca Benedict was described as the tragic princess who gulped a cup of her own poison and lost her life.

In fact, she gulped down the poison but did not lose her life.

She gulped down this poison not from a cup, rather to save her squire, who was so concerned for her master that she clung to the possibility of saving her life.

The poison stopped Prisca's heart for a moment and ended it all before it started to beat again.

The Imperial Election Ceremony was over and Prisca Benedict was buried in a tomb.

Vincent Abellux became Emperor, and Prisca Benedict assumed a different identity, a life not by that name――.

Chisha: "If I were from a family that has served the Empire of old, I might have cautioned His Excellency that his wish was outrageous. However, I hail from a family of commoners."

There is no prestige, no tradition, and no basis for being particularly appreciative of them.

A certain amount of respect is given, value is acknowledged, but there is no mistaking that it is the best. In the Vollachian Empire, that is the way it is.

And that is why――,

Chisha: [I had not the slightest bit of hesitation in taking part in this plan.]

Vincent: [――――]

The Emperor's silence, Vincent's mind impossible to fathom, but his actions were clear.

Among his many siblings, Prisca was special to Vincent. Although Prisca shone brightly in Chisha's eyes because of her talent, it was not only her ability that made Vincent so interested in his younger sister, even though Vincent was much older than her.

Despite her arrogance, Prisca respected Vincent and treated him as a blood related elder brother.

The Imperial Election Ceremony is the fate of the royal family of Vollachia, thus preventing them from coexisting despite mutual recognition and compromise ――which was broken by Vincent's hand.

That was a small relief for Chisha and, more importantly, it was a relief.

Vincent's approach is to demonstrate his full capabilities within the position and role he has been given.

Vincent has not changed his way of thinking from the day they met to the present day, so what kind of rationality is manifested in the fact that he chose to let Prisca live?

If she were found alive, he would endanger himself and lose the foundation of trust that the emperor had built up in the Vollachian Empire.

As Emperor of Vollachia, any argument could justify it.

It can't be done. Of course not. That was not a rationally given command.

It was an emotional desire, a wish,a prayer.

Vincent Abellux didn't want to kill his beloved sister.

So Prisca Benedict was kept alive and Vincent wore the false crown.

That made Chisha happy.

It wasn't that Prisca had been saved, but that Vincent wanted to keep Prisca alive, and asked Chisha for a way to get rid of the obstacle――the wheel stuck in the ditch.

Chisha: [Was that foreshadowing?]

The nonsense Cecilus uttered before the “Imperial Election Ceremony” began crossed his mind.

Even if it doesn't make sense at the moment and seems meaningless, later on some meaning can be found in it. It can be understood as having been there for that purpose.

The position and actions of himself and Chisha may be the foundation for such a future.

Chisha: [Well, it's really annoying to admit that Cecilus hit the mark, and I can see him getting carried away, so I won't ever tell him.]

Vincent: [It's been like this for a while, but lately I've been thinking a lot. Have you completely lost your hair color and everything you cultivated by serving this Emperor?]

Chisha: [Surprisingly, I've been doing well since wandering the abyss of death.]

Knowing it was disrespectful, Chisha shrugged in front of Vincent. The emperor, who has changed his position, won't blame him unless he does it in front of the public.

Vincent called himself “Emperor”, and the reflection of Chisha in his black eyes was, as he pointed out, completely white with no color.

During the "Imperial Selection Ceremony," Chisha's black hair had lost all of its color and turned completely white when he returned from the brink of death after being nearly killed by an enemy he had confronted.

Since then, he has been wearing white, which is the opposite of the black costumes he had been wearing for some reason. He has even repainted his favorite iron fan, and has thoroughly dressed his entire body in white.

Of course, it wasn't just for fun.

After wandering in the abyss of death and losing his hair color, Chisha developed a strange “Ability”. In order to handle this "Ability" that is dyed in the color of others, it is necessary to have a constant awareness.

It was a necessary measure to imply to himself that he would be dyed in any color.

In any case, the details of this "Ability" are hidden from Vincent as well. Of course, he won't reveal it to anyone, not even the loose lipped Cecilus or others with whom he has little connection.

It is always a good idea to have an ace up one's sleeve, a trump card, or a secret move or two ready to go.

However――,

Chisha: [If Your Excellency will finally release me for the great work I have done, then I do not think there is any need for such intrigue.]

Vincent: [Suppose if you were me, do you think I would let you go through the night in peace, knowing the most important fact that this empire must keep secret, and leave you alive?]

Chisha: [It's somewhat bad manners to develop a hypothetical story into a hypothetical story, but I think the end will be for this head to fall before it leaves the castle.]

Vincent: [If you understand that, and if you value your life, then continue to serve me obediently. Until you can prove that you are of use to me, I will keep you tied by the neck and torso.]

Vincent said this in an arrogant way while resting his chin in his hands on his desk.

It's hard to say if both of them are serious, but it's necessary for the emperor, who doesn't have enough words for others, to let him speak out like this and confirm it.

According to this, apparently Chisha Gold's position and required role will remain the same whether Vincent became emperor or not, but――,

Chisha: [――The state of the Sacred Vollachian Empire may or may not change.]

Already, the brilliant “Yang Sword”, the absolute symbol of the Vollachian Empire, has been betrayed.

Since the "Imperial Election ceremony" that has continued since the founding of the nation has ended in a different form than before, what will follow will also change dramatically in the future.

Going down that path is Vincent, who prioritized his own desires and chose to save his sister.

A new path will be opened up that is different from the one of the past. Chisha found himself slightly excited by that fact and the anticipation.

However, he never showed it in his expression, words, or attitude.

Because he was aware of the bad influence of his friend, Cecilus.

△▼△▼△▼△

――The days passed by at a dizzying pace.

The former system of the "Nine Divine Generals" was restored, and the rankings of the Imperial Nobility were reset.

Purging those who had lost their meaning and enjoyed high status because of history alone, the way of the Vollachian Empire which flew the national flag of a “wolf pierced by swords” was enforced at home and abroad without exception.

The way of doing things that had lasted till the previous Emperor, who unthinkingly believed the unwritten rule that the strong were absolutely right and let the Empire fall to ruin internally, was completely disavowed and the initial principle that the strong were respected was scrubbed out.

Those rested on their bloodlines and family’s social standing were robbed of what represented them, while those who had been waiting vigilantly for the opportunity to come around were given a chance to take on the challenge.

From the outside, Vincent Vollachia's reign might have seemed no different from the history of the Empire so far.

However, the reality was quite different. Those who knew what was going on behind the scenes experienced it firsthand.

Before long, it became something that many in the Empire, and even those outside in other countries, would likely know.

The grandeur of Vincent Vollachia's remaking and reforming of the Empire.

Useless conflicts would cease, and absurd deathmatches would no longer be applauded.

Proof of strength was no longer based on an individual's military prowess, and those who held ambitions not suitable for their stature would prove the difficulty of truly fulfilling those ambitions with their lives.

It was as if they were watching the process of completely changing the basis for what was “strong.”

However――,

???: [I'll be "First", Anya will be "Second", and after Olbart joins Chisha will be "Fourth". Your Excellency's choices aren’t so bad, but Chisha's complexion isn’t great, is it?]

Chisha: [I am "Fourth" because I feel a little uncomfortable in my position. As Cecilus knows, I am]

Cecilus: [For physical strength, absolutely. Well, well,  I don't claim to understand your feelings at all, but I guess this is the way the pecking order is determined in the world ruled by Your Excellency. It's hard to know which is which when there are mixed standards, but I'm rather positive about it.]

Abel: [What is the reason for that? Aside from the fact that you are the immovable "First."]

Cecilus: [You took the words out of my mouth! That's the biggest reason. But that's not the only one. I think having Chisha there will change your point of view.]

Abel: [Point of view…In other words can I take that to mean that of one’s way of fighting?]

Cecilus: [That’s the gist. If me and you Chisha go at it, you’ll die in the blink of an eye for sure, however, what if you start with a thousand men? It might take a thousand seconds!]

Chisha: [It would not. But I understand where you are coming from. While I gain a thousand seconds…]

Cecilus: [His Excellency, or someone else, can fulfill their purpose. My one greatest flaw as the leading actor of this world, is that there’s only one of me in this world.]

There were those whose natures would not change at all, even if they gained standing or the way of the Empire changed.

However, Cecilus embodied that first principle, the reason for why, in the oldest eras of the Vollachian Empire, “the strong” garnered respect from everyone.

Everyone throughout the Empire knew the person in question was unpopular, did not have a personality that would be liked by everyone, and did not have the character to be an example for anyone.

Still, should anyone be asked who the strongest in the Empire was, their chests swelled with pride as if they were tied to it personally.

It was Cecilus Segmunt that was the most powerful being in the Empire.

The fact that Chisha was considered to be able to take a thousand seconds by gathering people against Cecilus had also been the reason why he settled without firmly refusing the position of “Fourth” of the Nine Divine Generals.

Hence, even while thinking it was overvalued, Chisha had resigned himself to that position and role. For the most part, it worked well.

If there was a problem――,

???: [――My, my, isn’t this luucky~, General First-Class Chisha. Today’s fortunes are good, aren't they?]

A person who started a conversation like that in a friendly manner while smiling weakly.
 
When everything seemed to be going favorably in the Empire, the ominous feeling he held towards the being that introduced themself as a Stargazer and whose comings and goings to the Crystal Palace were permitted had felt like a black spot on his white body.

――That the ominous feeling had not been a mistake was proven years later.

The Stargazer: [――The coming of the Great Disaster has been passed down in a commandment. It is regrettable, Your Excellency.]

In the center of the Emperor’s office, a man who by all rights should not have been there had announced that with an expression as if to say that he was truly mystified.

Chisha, who was present at the meeting, frowned at the words of Ubilk, the Stargazer.

Chisha: […The Great Disaster?]

It was an unfamiliar sound and at the same time, it was a sound that was never a good sign.

It could also be called a great calamity. It could be predicted that it would be no ordinary disaster. However, what disturbed Chisha was the one addition that Ubilk added to it.

Why did this man continue to say to Vincent that it was a pity, etc.?

Chisha: [Ubilk-dono, we have no doubts about the authenticity of your Stargazer abilities. On numerous occasions, you have been able to anticipate insurrections, disasters, and possible domestic events. In many cases, Ubilk's prophecies have helped to limit the damage.]

Ubilk: [Pardon me, General First-Class Chisha. Hooowever~, I have one correction. I didn’t make any prophecies. I’m only speaking on the whispers of stars. I can’t take credit for that.]

Chisha: […I respect Ubilk-dono's opinion. Of course, we need to be prepared to deal with the Great Disaster, but may I ask what you expect to happen?]

Ubilk's expression in response to Chisha, which had been cryptic until then, transformed into a smile.

Chisha posed a question that needed to be asked while being suspicious of Ubilk, who was expressive but whose heart Chisha couldn’t determine.

The role of Ubilk, who called himself a Stargazer, was similar to that of a medicine man or fortune teller.

However, the accuracy of Ubilk's predictions was extraordinary, setting him apart from the medicine men who felt that an element of theatrics was used to boost morale.

However, the drawback is that there are many details that are vague and somewhat circular in terms of how much they relate to Ubilk's personality.

But, as Chisha also mentioned, there are actually a scattering of situations that were triggered by Ubilk's advocacy and were resolved without major incident, regardless of the genius of man-made disasters.

It is because of Vincent's appreciation of their abilities that they are allowed access to the Crystal Palace.

Chisha was not very keen on the heavy use of the mysterious Ubilk, but it is Vincent's position to use what is available.

For instance, the appointment of those who had served his brothers and sisters who had died in the Imperial Selection Ceremony was likewise considered insane. It would be insane to have Berstetz Fondalfon, the Prime Minister, at his side, even though he is one of the best in his field.

The prime minister, however, is a man who has a surprisingly strong faith in the empire, and as long as Vincent continues to act like Vincent, there is no fear that he will turn on him.

In any case――,

Chisha: [If you call it a Great Disaster, it must be incredibly difficult to evade it. Fortunately, both General First-Class Cecilus and Arakiya are available… Well, I can say that those two are usually always available because they are dangerous to leave them alone…]

Ubilk: [――Destruction, General First-Class Chisha.]

Chisha: [Mmm?]

Thinking of the faces of Cecilus and Arakiya, the First and Second, who had a special reason to be there, Chisha was about to be immersed in melancholy when an unexpected sound brought him back to reality.

Furrowing his brow more, Chisha gives Ubilk another opportunity to speak.

In response, Ubilk prefaced his remarks with the words, "That's why",

Ubilk: [What is coming is destruction, General First-Class Chisha. The Great Disaster is a catastrophe that will destroy the Vollachian Empire. It is a destruction beyond the reach of the sun's rays. alllthough~…]

Chisha: [――――]

Ubilk: [By its very nature, the Yang Sword cannot be used to its fullest potential. Riiight~?]

The moment Chisha, who was behind Vincent, heard this, jumped into the middle of the room and placed the iron fan he pulled out against Ubilk's neck, knocking him out of balance.

As it was, he tried to drive his iron fan into Ubilk's head, who had fallen to the ground, without any hesitation――,

Vincent: [――Stop Chisha. there's no point in killing them.]

Chisha: [But, Your Excellency. This thing knows things that it should not know. Surely, Your Excellency, did not tell him?]

Vincent: [Nonsense. I would never let my mouth slip to a clown. Most likely, as said, he learned it from the stars.]

Ubilk: [Ha-ha, that is correct. Say, am I about to die now?]

Ubilk pokes his finger at the iron fan, which stopped just before it hit, and gave a half-smile.

Looking down at it, Chisha wondered for a moment if he really should finish him off, then exhaled deeply and took a big step Back.

Chisha: [Forgive my rudeness. However, I would ask you to refrain from careless remarks, and I can't guarantee that the next time my hand will be stopped again.]

Ubilk: [Keho, how careless of me. As expected of one of the Nine Divine Generals, even though he has called himself a civic man, his skill was that of a warrior.

Chisha: [No need for flattery. Rather――]

Cutting off there, Chisha cut off his gaze from Ubilk and turned to look behind him.

 There, Vincent, in the same posture as when he welcomed the "Stargazer," sat at the large desk where he did his work, looked at us.

Faced with those black eyes, Chisha suddenly remembered how he met him.

――When he first met Vincent, it was about this distance between them inside the Dragon Carriage.

Why did he suddenly remember that time? Probably because it felt the same.

Still feeling the same way, Chisha had to ask Vincent.

Chisha: [Your Excellency, you seem unsurprised by Ubilk-dono's prediction. Can I ask you about his true intentions?]

Ubilk: [Um―, it isn’t a prediction… Uh.]

Chisha: [My apologies. However,if you interrupt next time there will be no warning.]

Ubilk tried to speak out of turn, and an iron fan grazed his cheek and pierced the wall. A drop of blood floated from his slightly cut cheek, and Ubilk raised his hands and vowed to remain silent.

Without looking in that direction, Chisha stared at Vincent――no, glared at him.

At Chisha's gaze, Vincent closed one eye,

Vincent: [He has already reported the signs of the disaster. The Observers have whispered that the coming “Great Disaster” will bring about the downfall of this empire.]

Chisha: [――, why didn’t you share it with me at that point in time… no.]

Chisha's tongue stopped when he was about to argue, even though he was astonished at what Vincent had told him. Just now, he felt an indescribable dread in what Vincent said.

Chisha's eyes widened slightly as he pondered what that was.

Chisha: [Your Excellency, if I'm not mistaken, did you say――observers?]

Many long years ago, he heard it from Vincent once.

“Stride Vollachia", an exiled member of the royal family whom Vincent called an abomination and a despicable person,that word is said to have been found in his journal.

Vincent mentioned it here. It was so natural that he had long since grasped it as a word associated with the "Stargazer" Ubilk, as well.

Chisha: [Your Majesty, by those Observers, do you mean the ''Stars'' that Ubilk-dono speaks of?]

Vincent: […I agree with you. What Ubilk said was an announcement of what the Observers had seen.]

Chisha: […So you think Stride Vollachia was also a “Stargazer”?]

Vincent: [I see that as a high possibility. However, he differed from the other ones calling themself “Stargazer” ,if you read the contents of his journal, you’ll see that Stride Vollachia was hostile to the Observers.]

Chisha's dissatisfaction with Vincent grew as the revelations unfolded.

Even before he became emperor, even after he became emperor, he willingly had a lot of work to do, but he also had such troubles that he didn't share with Chisha.

In order to keep it hidden from Chisha, it should take great effort.

If that amount of effort is put in, it would be good to share it from the beginning.

Ubilk: [Calm down, General Chisha. There's a reason your Excellency didn't talk to you General. I respect that decision.]

Chisha: [I thought I advised you that there would not be another warning.]

Ubilk: [I know, I know. But~ if your Excellency finds it difficult to say, I thought it would be better if I did. That's why I asked to be here with General Chisha, right?]

Ubilk looked at Vincent over Chisha's shoulder, still holding his hands up.

It was annoying that he acted like he knew what Vincent was thinking, but Vincent didn't turn down Ubilk's proposal.

Therefore, Chisha had no right to dismiss it. Besides, he can't afford to be held up any longer by what is not being said.

Chisha: [Without acting pompous, I advise you to choose your next words carefully.]

Ubilk: [Thank you for your consideration. Well then, I will tell you briefly. ――About the “Great Disaster” that will bring destruction to the empire.]

Despite being advised not to be pompous, Ubilk paused.

But anger at Ubilk was outweighed by interest in the words that followed. Thus, Ubilk continued unpunished for ignoring the warning.

That was――,

Ubilk: [――The death of His Excellency Vincent Vollachia, that is the signal for the beginning of the commandment.]

△▼△▼△▼△

The tactless Stargazer left the room, leaving only the top of the empire and his trusted confidant in the inner sanctum. ――No, Chisha is no longer sure whether that self-identification is correct.

If they cannot reveal their hearts, they cannot claim to be one's confidant.

Perhaps it was the clownish insinuations with which the Stargazer was being bombarded were more appropriate for him than he realized.

Chisha: [When I played the role of His Excellency, the "Stargazer" never approached me. Did His Excellency give you those instructions, too?]

???: [The conspiracy will collapse if people talk about what is being kept secret. If this is the case, it is only natural to tie up loose ends before something goes wrong.]

Chisha: [I guess. I'll do the same thing.]

Not so much collusion, but Ubilk, who appeared to be acting freely, was also firmly collared by Vincent.

There was a secret agreement between the two parties regarding the Great Disaster.

However――,

Chisha: [I don't understand. Why did you conceal it from me?]

Vincent: [――. In order to get rid of unnecessary and cumbersome thoughts.]

Chisha: [Unnecessary and cumbersome…]

Vincent: [Knowing this, you may think of saving me, but it is a pointless thought.]

Shaking his head, Vincent stated this without any hesitation.

Vincent is not intimidated by the fact that his life is at stake. However, his own conviction and Chisha's are on a different level.

Chisha: [It is only natural that I should put His Excellency's life first. Why do you call it pointless?]

Vincent: [Recall all the stories brought about by the Stargazer claiming it was a commandment.

Chisha: [The story brought to you by Ubilk-dono…]

At being told this, Chisha pondered.

If Vincent's Great Disaster was the only thing he kept from Chisha, Chisha was well aware of all the other prophecies brought by Ubilk.

Natural disasters and rebellions, both of which provided useful signs of a situation that could become a firestorm. Thanks to this, the damage was kept to a minimum――,

Chisha: [――Either of these situations has happened, with varying degrees of damage.]

Vincent: [Indeed. There has never been a case of being told the signs and being able to prevent it from happening. Whether it is a man-made or natural disaster, the first move always happens. Even if you can deal with the damage afterward.]

Ubilk also said.

Vincent: [He said that the 'Great Disaster' will be triggered by my death.]

Chisha: [――Hk, then I will abide by Your Excellency's will and defy the Stargazer's commandment!"

Vincent: [Do you not think that I have not tried to see if that is feasible?]

The reflexive objection is negated by Vincent's quiet words.

Understandably, Vincent would have put into practice all of Chisha's ideas, including those that came to him emotionally.

In the past, other prophecies brought about by Ubilk, unrelated to the Great Disaster, have been challenged time and again to see if they could be prevented.

While fulfilling the role of Emperor to the fullest extent, behind the scenes――,

Chisha: [――Your Excellency.]

Vincent: [What?]

Chisha: [I have a question I just had come to mind.]

Suddenly, Chisha's own voice, cold and somber, slipped into his brain.

He said what he wanted to hear, but his brain is numb. It is numb. It is either a reaction to being overworked or a mental resistance denying it from working.

However, regardless of the reason for the numbness, the question had already been raised and the Emperor had received it.

And then――,

Vincent: [Speak, let it be stated.]

Chisha cannot deny what the emperor has chosen.

Hence, Chisha cannot refuse what the Emperor has granted permission for.

And so, Chisha enjoys the numbness of his own brain, and asks the question.

Chisha: [Since when did you notice the signs of the Great Disaster?]

Vincent: [――The journal.]

Quietly, Vincent opened a drawer in his desk, took out an old bound book, and placed it on his desk.

A journal that was mentioned in the past, but was never seen. ――If the journal left by Stride Vollachia had conveyed the signs.

Chisha: [Your Excellency, what you have done so far――]

He met Chisha, who was originally Chesha Trim, walked with him, cultivated time together, picked up Cecilus, went to the Imperial Selection Ceremony, saved Prisca Benedict's life by going against his own principles for the first time, and paved the way for himself as the new emperor of the Vollachian Empire.

The whole of Vincent Vollachia's journey is――.

Vincent: [――After my death, the destruction caused by the Great Disaster must be minimized. This is the reason for the reform of the Nine Divine Generals.]

Chisha: [――――]

Vincent: [――It is you, Chisha Gold.]

△▼△▼△▼△

Chisha: [I demand to know who these Observers are, and for you to disclose whatever information you may have on them.]

Pushing the open iron fan against another’s neck, Chisha issued a threat, his tone low.

However, as Chisha directed that ghastly hostility at him, the facial expression of Ubilk, who’d had his back pinned against the wall, was a carefree one, unable to read the situation, as if bemused.

His expression unchanging, Ubilk called out to him with "General First-Class Chisha”, then continued,

Ubilk: [I’d thought that you and His Excellency the Emperor had discussed that a few days ago, and that you had come to terms with it down inside, General First-Class Chisha…]

Chisha: [It took me a few days to review the preconditions to make sure there was no mistake. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to directly reject His Excellency’s thoughts.]

Ubilk: [I’m sure it’d be the same even if you’d discussed it with me. But, as expected from the General First-Class who also serves as His Excellency’s body double, you do take after him plenty.]

While being held in place Ubilk spoke, to which Chisha produced a faint look of puzzlement. Taking in that reaction from Chisha, Ubilk shook his head, then stated,

Ubilk: [His Excellency also asked if there was a way to bend the commandment. Buuut~, I can return you the same answer as I did then. There is not.]

Chisha: [――. What is your purpose? Ubilk-dono, you have introduced yourself as a Stargazer, thus gaining the position to stay at the Crystal Palace and deliver prophecies from the Observers. Myself at the helm, people aside from His Excelency do not think highly of your existence, Ubilk-dono. If His Excellency does pass away as per the prophecy, you shall not escape destruction.]

Ubilk: [You put that so clearly it hurts me… Buuut~, General First-Class Chisha, that assumption of yours is off.]

Chisha: [――――]

Ubilk: [More important than my own destruction, is the fulfillment and realisation of the commandment. My purpose, is to ward off the destruction due to follow the Great Disaster.]

As he spoke, the grin disappeared from Ubilk's face.

Ubilk’s face, vanished of the artificial emotion it had possessed, had lost its warmth. Capturing it from up-close, made Chisha get an impression as if he were facing Ubilk’s real face for the first time.

For an instant, he suspected that that was due to some technique of Ubilk’s――,

Ubilk: [I don't have any power of that sort. Didn’t I destroy my own Evil Eye in front of your very eyes, General First-Class Chisha, as to display I held no malice towards His Excellency at the very start? Do you wish to confirm that?]

Chisha: [――. No, that is fine. Unless I have misheard, you, Ubilk-dono, have stated this? That your purpose is to ward off the destruction due to follow the Great Disaster.]

Ubilk: [Yes, that’s correct. In that respect, that purpose is in accord with His Excellency’s.]

The replying Ubilk was devoid of faltering, and Chisha could perceive no falsehoods in his opinion.

If he were to lie here in the first place, it made no sense that he would not lie to make himself, rather than Vincent, look good to Chisha. Even Ubilk would not be too thrilled were he to be killed after carelessly provoking Chisha’s ire, most likely, despite that expression of his suggesting he did not mind being killed at any time.

In addition, even though he had some thoughts on Ubilk’s behavior and perceived him as a nuisance, Vincent’s reasons for not sending Ubilk away were understandable.

Vincent and Ubilk were both working toward the same goal.

Chisha: [It does not seem to me that Ubilk-dono is thinking of preventing the Great Disaster itself. Why is that?]

Ubilk: [Oh, it's simple. The Great Disaster cannot be postponed. It’s the sort of established rule where it’ll happen without fail. My purpose, once the Great Disaster has happened, is to ward off the destruction it brings. In other words…]

Chisha: [In other words?]

Ubilk: [If the Great Disaster doesn’t actually happen, my commandment won’t be fulfilled. For that reason, even if all the factors that’d cause the Great Disaster are destroyed, I’d become said factor.]

That was a fanatical way of thinking, the means and the ends were both mixed up.

Gulping at that incomprehensible absurdity, the iron fan that was already on Ubilk’s neck was made to dig into it with further force by Chisha. Pointed against a vital point, putting enough force into it would have Ubilk’s throat being severed there.

Allowing Ubilk himself to understand this, Chisha’s voice became sharper.

Chisha: [Then it would be best if we remove that factor with our own hands hereee.]

Ubilk: [I wish you wouldn't, but I’m not gonna stop you. Thooough~ let me tell you one thing, supposing you kill me, the next Stargazer will appear. That's how it works.]

Chisha: [――――]

Ubilk: [Four major disasters will destroy the world. The opportunity to stop one of them has come. We are terminals of self-purification and self-defense brought about by the stars, and there are infinite substitutes.]

Staring into those eyes from which nothing could be sensed, Chisha ground his teeth.

That there were no threats, no falsehoods, and that Ubilk himself was at least speaking seriously, was something that Chisha could sense.

――In order to ward off the destruction wrought by the Great Disaster, he would make it so the Great Disaster would happen without fail.

A declaration far too absurd, far too illogical, yet it was an invitation to a war of attrition, employing countless lives as shields, that even Vincent was unable to do anything about.

A possibility popped up, however; that perhaps, of some of the Stargazers who had brought commandments thus far themselves had served as sparks, playing a role in the materialization of their prophecies.

But if they were to ascertain this and massacre the Stargazers, eradicating them, being that the conditions for their emergence were not known, it was likely that they would need to murder all those capable of becoming one.

That, would be tantamount to destroying the country.

Ubilk: [His Excellency is admirable. Having attachment to individuals is something that makes up very little part of my nature, but I gotta take my hat off to His Excellency for the way he is. With him not being on the level of a Stargazer, he can’t be like that.]

Chisha: […Ubilk-dono admiring someone that greatly, what an unfunny jokeee.]

Ubilk: [I truly mean it. There’s no one able to accept their death forewarned by the commandment with peace of mind. And yet His Excellency’s making all preparations for after his own death. Even if he has no hopes left for living, he hasn’t given up fighting. Truly, the King of Sword Wolves.]

Ubilk's words, muttered solemnly, were a solid expression of his admiration for Vincent.

The Sword Wolf he had spoken of, the "wolf pierced by swords" that was the national emblem of Vollachia, was a celebration to the way of life of a warrior that did not falter even when saddled with life-threatening wounds.

In that sense, as Ubilk had declared, Vincent’s way of life was that of the Sword Wolf itself.

Ubilk: [General First-Class Chisha, I’ve spent all my life with the intent to fulfill my commandment with my entire heart. Buuut~, it’s not like I believe that my commandment is more wonderful than all. In case you’re saying it’s difficult to accept, General First-Class Chisha, it’s okay if you were to try it out.]

Chisha: [Try it out… Exterminating you, Ubilk-dono, and those with the same station you have, you mean?]

Ubilk: [I did state that there are infinite substitutes, but there’s a limit. There are only so many lives. Trying it out with the support of General First-Class Cecilus would be worth the shot.]

Once more, Ubilk’s mind was hard to grasp in regards to just how much of that proposal came from what he truly felt.

For a moment, Chisha did consider it to be a decent idea, proof of just how shaken up he was.

Supposing he did as Ubilk had stated, disclosed that fact to Cecilus and guided him as the latter probably did nothing but babble, they may be able to wipe out the citizens of the Empire.

――No, that too was impossible.

Were Vincent to discover that plot, he would halt any nonsense of the sort immediately. Cecilus was a friend, but his priorities were very much fixed within his mind.

For Cecilus, Vincent took precedence over Chisha. And that was the reasoning as to why Cecilus Segmunt was the First, even though his head was not to be trusted one bit when it came to thinking.

Chisha: [Nevertheless, the likes of disclosing this to Cecilus was an option that had not occurred to me, and that is quite laughable, even if I say so myself.] 

An out-of-place, deep emotion carved a faint smile onto Chisha’s lips.

Emerging in his head vividly, was Cecilus pouting his lips, protesting vehemently――,

Chisha: [――――]

He suddenly recalled an exchange they’d had one day quite clearly.

Cecilus: [If me and you Chisha go at it, you’ll die in the blink of an eye for sure, however, what if you start with a thousand men? It might take a thousand seconds!]

Chisha: [It would not. But I understand where you are coming from. While I gain a thousand seconds…]

Cecilus: [His Excellency, or someone else, can fulfill their purpose. My one greatest flaw as the leading actor of this world, is that there’s only one of me in this world.]

The smiling face of his friend as he spoke of random things came to mind.

Suddenly, he had a thought.

Chisha: [Ubilk-dono, I would like to inquire something of you. ――These commandments you receive, in what way are they brought to you?]

Having been questioned, Ubilk widened his eyes in amazement slightly.

He then cocked his head, regaining his usual atmosphere of meekness that had vanished, and,

Ubilk: [It varies. More often than not, I receive them in something like a dream.]

Chisha: [Then, would that also apply to the commandment regarding the Great Disaster that you have conveyed to His Excellency?]

With the questions piling up, Ubilk nodded with a face of perplexion. Exhaling at that answer, slowly, Chisha gave form to the thoughts that he’d had.

Chisha: [If, in the commandment you have received, the moment His Excellency loses his life is present――]

Pure white vanished, and thus, he painted over his uncertain self that could be dyed in any colour, not just with anyone.

Appearing there was――,

Chisha: [――The Vincent Vollachia that dies there, which one is it, I wondeeer?]

△▼△▼△▼△

――Chisha Gold, formerly Chesha Trim, did not consider himself to be someone with a very high sense of loyalty, nor had he pledged unwavering obedience to His Excellency the Emperor.

As none other than Vincent Vollachia himself had stated.

At a time Chisha had been asked if he would be willing to die for Vincent, returning the direct reply that he would not do so.

To keep that in mind as he served him, so had Chisha been told. 

In accordance with that declaration, and with those sentiments, Chisha had come to serve Vincent.

Therefore, he would not do anything akin to dying for Vincent’s sake.

Even if he did not pledge unwavering loyalty to Vincent, he pledged a loyalty born of common sense. As one of the people of the Empire, as one of the Generals of the First-Class of the Empire, he also happened to possess some sense of respect towards for His Excellency the Emperor.

Conduct that felt as if it ran counter to Vincent’s command, was preposterous.

Hence, Chisha's choice was something made not for Vincent’s sake, but for all intents and purposes, it had been made for the sake of those very same feelings at the very origin of it all, when he had happened to run into the prince on that road.

Back then, the many people around him had avoided getting involved upon laying eyes on that carriage, which they could tell at a glance had high-class folk riding in it.

They would have been fine with helping out, but if they turned out not to be able to, instead incurring displeasure, their lives would be in jeopardy.

While able to perfectly grasp the thoughts of those people, Chisha had stepped up to the carriage.

It was not as though he had wanted to help people.

However, he had thought it a shame were he to miss out on the opportunity to test his arithmetic and studies, which were said to be useless in the village that was his hometown.

Indeed, same went this time around.

A chance to get behind the thoughts of Vincent Vollachia, a man whose ingenuity could make anything go according to his hypotheses, would probably never come around again. 

Moreover, ever since Vincent Vollachia had been a young child, he had steeled himself to accept that moment with solemnity.

In other words, this was a challenge to partake in a crucial bout on which the life of Vincent Vollachia was staked.

A man whose blood would boil once the gauntlet was thrown down, a man whose spirits would rise more and more upon the realization that his enemy was a mighty one indeed, a man whose soul would ignite as a means to fell his opponent. That was a man of the Empire.

And Chisha Gold, was a man of the Empire.

What sort of feelings, what sort of thoughts had been in Vincent Vollachia’s mind, at the time he had decided to place Chisha under his care, as to learn under him, to become capable of using the same intelligence as himself after his own demise, were unclear.

He did not understand, nor did he want to understand.

Once he understood that he did not understand, he’d had many of those hot-headed thoughts.

Vincent had once given a few words on it, that he had experienced those very same thoughts.

And thus――,

Chisha: [The ruin brought about by the Great Disaster… Just what is the Great Disaster, don’t make me laaaugh.]

Labeled as the likes of a disaster on a great scale, it seemed the Great Disaster would somehow try to trample, to plunge the Vollachian Empire into ruination. From Chisha’s point of view however, it was humorous. 

The Great Disaster would commence with the death of Vincent Vollachia.

The Great Disaster would not start without Vincent's death, in other words, the Empire could not be destroyed if he were allowed to live, so had he not already lost before the destruction had started?

Setting Vincent Vollachia aside, what was the destruction to come, what was the Great Disaster?

――Vincent Vollachia, the Seventy-Seventh Emperor of the Sacred Vollachian Empire.

Chisha: [His Excellency himself is the Vollachian Empire. The utter devastation and ruin of the land after the death of His Excellency is an incredibly absurd, side-splitting, comedy of comedies.]

He ridiculed the yet-unseen Great Disaster with a manner of speech akin to Cecilus. 

Ridiculing the Great Disaster that he most likely would never lay eyes upon, he stuck out his tongue.

Chisha: [A dog that seeks to snatch a lowly victory, how can that be the one to kill our Sword Wolf? ――Don’t you dare underestimate Vincent Vollachia, who I supported, who I built up.]

If you are someone who can kill him, then what are you waiting for? If you say you will snatch him away, go for it.

Forewarned ruin and all the like, don’t you dare think that you can destroy our Emperor, our Empire.

That day, when I got the wheel out of the ditch, it was for the sake of this moment.

For the sake of ridiculing this destruction, all of it was――,

Chisha: [――Foreshadowing. Though, I shall absolutely not say such a thing, Cecilus would get overly enthused if I did.]

△▼△▼△▼△

――A white light shone dazzlingly within the throne room, and immediately afterward, scarlet blood splattered grandly.

Upon the red carpet, a slender man stood, drenched by the fresh blood that had just been scattered.

The man, donning a ridiculous oni mask on his face, widened his black eyes hidden behind the mask, frozen in shock at the events that had developed in front of him.

And before that man who was standing stock still, the body that had gushed copious amounts of its blood crumbled, toppling to its front.

His chest, lacking any defenses, had been run through from behind, destroying his heart without a shred of mercy, eradicating, ripping away anything and everything necessary for the maintenance of life.

Abel: [――――]

Unable to support the falling body with his arms, it helplessly collapsed onto the carpet.

With that, the fallen body did not stir, with nary a twitch, nor with even a gulp of air much less any final words.

None may live, having had their hearts pierced.

Consequently, that was an event inevitable, the terminus of fate as was bound to arrive.

Abel: [――――]

The man had died.

He was Chesha Trim, became Chisha Gold, and finally as Vincent Vollachia, the man had died.

――And that was the entirety of what had transpired, in that moment.
