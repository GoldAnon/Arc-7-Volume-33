*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――The Kingdom of Lugunica, the Vollachian Empire, the Holy Kingdom of Gusteko, and the Kararagi City-States.

――Each of the four major countries, commonly referred to as the Four Great Powers, had developed its own culture, which was tailored to its land; most notably, the pro-dragon spirit of the Kingdom of Lugunica and the Spirit Arts faith of the Holy Kingdom of Gusteko. The four major countries had taken different paths, as if by design.

This was true not only in terms of national culture and style, but also in terms of the quality of “warriors”.

In the Vollachian Empire, “magic” had hardly developed at all.

The gate and other prerequisites in their bodies were no different from those of other countries, no matter whether they were across the border or not, but compared to Lugunica and Kararagi, the Empire lagged far behind the others in this area.

The Empire, however, did not take that fact to heart.

Of course, falling behind other countries in any field was not welcome, but the fact that the field of magic was not developed meant that other fields were developed instead.

Compared to the technological prowess of the Kararagi City-States, the Spirit Arts and spells of the Holy Kingdom of Gusteko, and the magical disciplines of the Kingdom of Lugunica, the Vollachian Empire excelled in martial arts.

???: [Sometimes it's faster to just swoop in and hit them than to use magic, right?]

And, while this not Spiritual Arts Users-like statement can be fully affirmed, this was close to the general attitude towards magic in the Vollachian Empire.

Though this was highly misunderstood, and kind of the fact that is not being stipulated as well, the use of mana in the human body was not only limited to casting magic.

A small number of martial arts techniques were based on it, in the same way it was used in Spirit Arts, Spells, and in the activation of some Meteors.

It was perfectly natural for an elite warrior, especially, to use mana to strengthen his own body.

At times, If one who possessed unnatural physical abilities were compared to ordinary people, the trick was the handling of the mana that circulated within the body―― a technique called the Flow Method, which was done consciously.

However――,

???: [Cha-cha-cha-cha!]

With a thump, only one foot touched the ground, and in an instant the distance closed by a dozen meters.

If one were to track the figure from the side, it would seem as if time had been stolen, with its extraordinary body movements, but this was neither an illusion nor an optical illusion.

The anomaly was none other than the blue-haired boy who ran through the battlefield.

Following the explanation given immediately before, the boy's sprinting, which effortlessly transcended human limitations, must have been the result of the Flow Method. However, beneath the boy's young age and sharp good looks, there appeared no record of the days spent learning such techniques.

Rarely in the world were there such beings. ――There were those who were born unknowingly exercising the Flow Method, which was even said to be one of the ultimate martial arts, and would leave those who were caught up in the natural law behind.

Running down the hillside in a single breath, the boy plunged into the battlefield in search of the honor of the first spear.

Although――

???: [If the battle has already begun, the honor of being the first spear is nothing, but let's not worry about the details!]

He broke into the battlefield from the western lands and gazed at the great army surrounding the star-shaped walls in the distance. The long, slitted eyes of the boy were blazing and wet with excitement that would never be felt in a battlefield where grief and joy alternates.

A being that went into battle without proper footwear, without armor or a helmet, without a cause of any kind―― it was a barbaric act that could be seen as hostile by both those inside and outside the walls, those who wanted to protect the current Empire and those who wanted to destroy it.

However――,

???: [The high level of ambition is a point worthy of note. With or without it, the appealingness of your speech that flows from your mouth changes. It's just――]

???: [What!?]

In red gear and crude armor, there were skirmishes between small groups of dozens each who were clearly hostile to each other. A boy interrupted from the side, and a soldier wielding a sword cried out.

An admirably clear tone of voice, a mixture of anger, frustration, excitement, but with a fighting spirit prevailing. It was a clever move that called for caution against an intruder on the battlefield.

???: [――but it's fatally slow!]

???: [Wh-]

It was correct to shout, but wrong to stop and ask who they were.

It was only right that any being who appeared on the battlefield without revealing his or her allegiance should be assumed to be an enemy. The soldier should not have only alerted his surroundings, but also slashed at the sound of the voice.

Still, the enemy was faster, and if one needed to, they could point to ten or twenty other faults.

???: [Oh, and if what you just said was a line that came out because you didn't ask my affiliation, but because you had no idea who I was, then I'm sorry for being too lightning-fast, I would say.]

A soldier with a white eye fell to the ground behind the boy, who babbled quickly. As they passed each other, he drove a sharp hand blade into his neck. He expected to be able to chop his head off, but the blow was not powerful enough.

Waving his arms around, he twisted his head, still feeling indifferently.

???: [It's a frustrating thing when you feel like you can do something but you can't. I'm sure I don't intend to mix up ideals and wishes with the feasibility of reality. Well, if I accidentally let him die, it will lower <u>Boss's</u> confidence in me, so let's call the result good!]

Immediately after shaking off the hesitation so bluntly, the laughing boy's figure turned into a blur.

A moment later, he avoided a sword strike descending on his position, and the back of the boy's sole hit the soldier in the side, launching him in the opposite direction. The boy leapt off the soldier as he kicked him, and landed into the group behind that was following the soldier, striking a blow to each of their vital points and then disengaging. ――He then slipped into the group next to them, and cut off the consciousness of another five or so. It all happened in the blink of an eye.

Both the follow-up and the main objective of the manoeuvre were a theft of the time of the surrounding soldiers.

In other words, the behavior of the boy's body was beyond human comprehension and could not be pursued with raw strength - the ultimate expression of the development of martial arts in the Vollachian Empire.

Of course, it was not so easy for anyone to analyse such a situation on the battlefield, or to swallow that a child of twelve or thirteen years old was capable of such a thing.

More than anything else--

???: [――Tactless.]

???: [―――]

???: [It’s not tactful to try to undermine the skill and good looks of a star actor during his performance. The stage needs no more than to be admired, to enthral and captivate. Of course, if I were to go on stage in the same way, I would have to assert a more flamboyant appearance by means of an opponent... worthy of it.]

The group gasped at the boy glaring at his surroundings in the centre of the crumbling Imperial Guard.

The soldiers, who should have been clashing weapons and fighting for their lives, both sides were engulfed by the boy's presence, and time, or life, was robbed from them.

???: [Nah, it's all about the actor.......]

Taking another person's life. The boy got a certain satisfaction from that sensation.

As the boy was enjoying this sense of achievement, one of the poorly armed warriors on the opposing side of the Imperial Guard, many of whom had been defeated, opened his mouth and said, "You."

???: [Where's this guy from? Is he one of ours?]

???: [Hmm, hmm, hmm, do I belong to you? That's quite a good question, dear. Who on earth do you think I am? A friend or a foe?]

???: [―――]
The warrior who had asked the question clammed up after the question was answered in such a tedious manner. The boy's smile deepened at this, and he shook his head, "No, no."
 
 ???: [I wasn't teasing you. I just thought about it seriously too. So I always think. I didn't really listen to <u>Boss</u>, so I don't really know whose side he's on.]

???: [Huh?]

???: [So for now, I'm going to make sure that the dewdrops eliminate both sides.]

The warrior rolled his eyes, then his startled face blurred to the side, and the next moment he flipped over on the ground.

The smirking boy's figure was swept away, and this time he slipped into a group of warriors who were in conflict with the imperial soldiers he had just defeated, and furiously mowed them down.

The blue hair danced and the sound of sharp strikes seemed to echo through the air, and then the consciousness of the warriors were erased without as much as a bitter cry. The violence, just like a storm―― no,

???: [Blue Thunderbolt…]

???: [Oh, great. That's exactly the alias I was thinking of calling myself, too.]

The warrior, who spilled a breath snatched in shock, was rendered unconscious by his last words.

It was the Vollachian way to respond to both friendly and hostile attitudes with equal violence - barbarism that would raise the eyebrows of even the emperor of this country.

But no one could stop the boy from doing so.

And that was the most correct thing to do in this imperial fashion.

???: [Uh, oh―!]

The late warriors started to focus on the threat of that small whirlwind of a boy.

No longer were there any distinctions between Imperial soldiers and rebels, but everyone's consciousness was united in stopping that boy. That was, in a sense, the scene of a great achievement, stopping a civil war all alone.

However, their decision to be brave was not followed by a peaceful answer.

Lean back and avoid the blade. Dance back and avoid fist strikes. Go between the legs and avoid axe blows. Dodge arrows, dodge spears, dodge fangs, dodge shields, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge - dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.

???: [Without weapons.......]

???: [Yes, that's the trouble. I also think it would be much more colourful to show off my skills with a weapon than with my bare hands, but I don't want to use something half-baked. The best of the best wield the best of the best. Oh, and this is from my <u>Boss</u>.]

???: [Bosu …?]

???: [Yes. ――We're the head of the Pleiades Battalion, you know.]

The boy's smile grew deeper as he boasted, effortlessly dodging the killing intent and hostility being hurled at him. The unfamiliar words uttered by the boy's mouth filled the warriors with a sense of unexplainable fear.

They should all have come to risk their lives in the battle to decide the course of this empire.

Nevertheless, they did not know the affiliation of the boy toying with them, the limit to his strength, the true meaning of his words and deeds, or anything.

I don't know what's going on, but everything seems to be going the way the boy wants it to――.

――The next moment, a tremendous yell was heard from the direction of the hills in the far distance.

Who could blame the warrior for cowering in shock? Upset and confusion spread to the other warriors as well.
Hence, the smile on the boy's mouth became larger, not because he mocked the frightened state of the warriors, but something more straightforward.

???: [Well, the first thing to show off, <u>Boss</u>. ―― I hope you're going to make a big show of it.]

△▼△▼△▼△

At this point, it is necessary to mention a very unfortunate fact about "magic."

This is a different issue from the one described previously, where the Vollachian Empire has developed only physical martial arts and "flow methods" instead of magical techniques.

This is because "Yang magic" and "Yin magic," which have few users among the six magic attributes in this world, are neglected for reasons other than the fact that they are difficult to research.

The Fire attribute manipulates heat to produce flame or even ice.

The Water attribute interferes with the life force of living things, promotes the healing of wounds and illnesses, and saves lives.

The Wind attribute interferes with the atmosphere to regulate the environment and sometimes even ensures survivability in hazardous regions.

The Earth attribute, which manipulates the power of the earth and can either fertilize or starve the land.

Compared to those attributes, each of which has a clear image of the use case, the Yin and Yang attribute is basically considered to be an effect that either enhances or decreases the function of the human body.

While strictly speaking a false understanding, the fact that such an image has taken hold is a major factor in the lack of progress in the development of the respective Yin and Yang magic attributes today.

And perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the "Yang attribute" ――its power to enhance one's abilities that continues to receive a reputation for being out of place and useless.

Knowing the primary effects of yang magic, many may be tempted to question as to why in its evaluation.

However, the more one tries to take advantage of this characteristic, the more there are several very troublesome problems that can not be ignored.

For example, if you look at the effects of yang magic to improve one's physical abilities, in most cases, they were defeated by the enemy without such abilities.

The reason was simple: they could not handle their own enhanced bodies at all, and were unable to use all their strengths, feeling as if they were manipulating someone else's body.

The enhancement of one's abilities may include strengthening the senses, such as eyesight and hearing, enhancing physical abilities, such as arm and leg strength, and strengthening defenses by increasing the density of bones and muscles.

However, warriors always train their own bodies and go into battle knowing their own skills.

Those who received yang magic would throw away their current selves and enter the battlefield in a modified body only with improved performance characteristics. As a result, many of them were defeated and died without being able to do much.

The problem continues to be the fact that the effectiveness of yang magic is greatly affected by the skill of the caster themself, as well as their physical and mental condition that day.

Even if a warrior who has received Yang magic can adapt to his enhanced body, there is no guarantee that he will receive the same enhancement from the same caster tomorrow, or that it will be as effective.

Yang magic is not expected to improve one's ability to fight consistently; on the contrary, it is recognized as a flaw that prevents one from satisfactorily demonstrating one's usual abilities. ――This is the reason why Yang magic has been neglected.

In the past, the Vollachian Empire also had an emperor who focused on the power of magic and wanted to create the most powerful army. The 31st emperor of the Vollachian Empire, Murkia Vollachia, planned to use magic to turn a powerful army into an even more powerful one.

Based on the aforementioned shortcomings, he paired a yang magic user with a strong soldier, trained them so that the enhanced state would be their natural state, and then went into actual battle.

However, the results were disastrous: the strong soldiers, who were supposed to be enhanced, were killed before any yang magic could be applied, the skills of the essential casters were varied, the troops could not function as troops, they were outnumbered, and even the emperor's life was in jeopardy.

The war finally ended when Viva the "Dissector," a close ally of the then-Emperor of Vollachia, defeated the enemy general, but due in part to the magnitude of the defeat, Murkia-Vollachia was given the ignominious nickname of "Emperor of the Great Defeat" As such, the magnitude of the defeat was such that the name was engraved on the history of Murkia Vollachia.

Because of this precedent, the value of yang magic, and thus magic itself, was devalued in Vollachia, leading to the spread of the idea that mastery of martial arts was the sign of a strong soldier.

This has not changed to this day, and Vincent Vollachia, with all his wisdom and ingenuity, has dismissed the use of Yang magic in group battles as something that is beyond consideration.

In fact, when a user of yang magic can only enhance one target at a time, the operation of an army that requires a plurality of soldiers to do the same amount of work is a pipe dream.

Therefore, Yin magic remained as a means of harassment in the sense of inflicting unusual physical effects on the enemy, and magic declined in the Vollachian Empire ――even in other countries, Yang magic was considered an unfavorable discipline that was seldom used except for self-enhancement.

――However, as with everything, exceptions existed.

Subaru: [Let's do it, you guys――!!]

With a large inhale, the boy's voice, still high, was raised in the hills to the west, with the battlefield in the distance.

With the boy at their heart, warriors spread out atop the hill―― a band comprised of no less than several thousand people, who one-by-one raised a banner for the sake of expressing the unity, the will of the group.

A symbol of a will to fight that must never be lowered, the large banner was held aloft by a man to the boy’s side, the former’s body covered in tattoos, supported by a gray lizardman, and a man with a dull appearance yet possessing a dignified look in his eyes.

Depicted on the banner that had been hoisted, recognizable even from a distance, was an insignia with the shape of a star.

It was not the crest of one’s family, neither was it the crest of the nation. Merely the proof of where their hearts lay it was, a declaration of war of sorts and naught else.

The group assembled was a diverse one―― without exaggeration, it was composed of many races.

Even within Vollachia, where a gargantuan number of species lived and coexisted, few relationships in which cooperation was possible even across racial lines. The Demon City of Chaosflame had been one of the few functional cities that posed an exception to that, and even during the siege of the Imperial Capital, there had been no sense of cooperation from the rebels.

But, this group was different.

It was possible to see them as simply working together towards the same purpose. However, this did not mean they could gather under a banner as to brandish a collective will.

It was not that they possessed the same purpose, but that they possessed a shared will.

Hence why this group―― Nay, why the Pleiades Battalion, was able to serve as a trump card.

Spearheading those banners, spearheading the comrades he had gathered, a boy of black hair―― Natsuki Subaru, exclaimed.

Subaru: [――We are, THE STRONGEST!!]

Pleiades: [The strongest! The strongest!! THE STRONGEST!!]

Elevating a war cry in concert, a thunderous roar echoed throughout the heavens, tremendous fighting spirit spreading through the battlefield like tongues of flame.

Beatrice, being held in Subaru's arms as he yelled, covered her ears, her eyes widening in amazement. Likewise, Louis too jumped onto Subaru. Though, only those two young girls were surprised.

Subaru: [――We are, INVINCIBLE!!]

Pleiades: [Invincible! Invincible!! INVINCIBLE!!]

Hiain, Weitz, Idra, Gustav, Orson and the others of his group, Old Man Null, Rex, Milzak, Kashew, Moizo, Deeroy, Creegkin, Codroe, Phenmelle, Jawsrough, Tanza, roared loudly.

The ground quaked as they stamped their feet upon the soil, the quaking beckoning further quaking, rousing their fighting spirit.

In the recesses of his chest, was something ardent.

That ardent, ardent, oh so ardent, trustworthy, irresistible something, coarsed through the entirety of his body.

Placing that ardent, trustworthy, irresistible something atop his tongue――

Subaru: [――OHHHHHHHHHHH INEVITABLE FAAAAAAAATE!!]

Pleiades: [BRING IT ON! BRING IT ON!! BRING IT ON!!!]

The group bellowed in unison, and the eyes of all its members turned to the fore, to the battlefield at the foot of the hill.

And thus――,

Subaru: [――Let’s go.]

△▼△▼△▼△

The sensation of the sky, the ground, and the world shaking was felt by everyone on the battlefield at the moment.

Among those who could not treat it as anything else were those on the western ramparts who were to collide head-on with the flag-bearing groups running down the hillside―― the Imperial Soldiers ordered to defend the fourth bastion, which was closest to them.

???: [But――]

Not to be defeated by the spirit, Gudda Dialmo, the Imperial General Second-Class "Tiger Hunter", held his ground.

For a moment, he was overwhelmed by the sudden appearance and high morale of the opposition. However, the Imperial Soldiers, the subordinates of the "Tiger Hunter", were not low enough in strength to be beaten by such projectiles.

Above all, the wear and tear on Gudda and his men was almost minimal as far as this battlefield was concerned.

The Imperial Capital had been under tremendous siege, but the harsh attacks made against the other bastions had little effect on this fourth bastion.

This was undoubtedly the achievement of Olbart Dunkelkenn, who reigned as the guardian of the fourth bastion, and was a true demonstration of "The Wily Old Man".

???: [In the first place, it's a good idea to cut off the opponent's legs before you reach here. It's a basic rule of warfare that you cut off what you can't fight without, whether it's water or weapons.]

“The Wily Old Man”, who described the reason why the enemy's offensive was overwhelmingly weak compared to other bastions, had a cruelty that sent chills down the spines of generals at the fear of not being an ally.

However, even Olbart would have had to rush to the other bastions to fulfil his role of protecting the Imperial Capital if they were about to be overtaken.

Therefore, the current fourth bastion lacked the power of the Nine Divine Generals, the greatest strength of the Empire.

Olbart's legacy, his trained superhuman Shinobi, must deal with the flying dragon squadrons that had appeared from the same western sky as the approaching army.

Since they did not have flying weapons, Shinobi's techniques were their only means of defending themselves against the flying dragon squadron.

And for the group that rushed in fiercely――,

Gudda: [――I will give it my all!]

With these words, Gudda Dialmo stared at the enemy in front of him, carrying two metal clubs, each weighing nearly a hundred kilograms, which were synonymous with the nickname "Tiger Hunter”.

Gudda's alias was attributed to the fact that when he was still a General Third-Class, he destroyed a group of tiger men who were committing tyranny in the country, and took the head of the enemy general who had killed the two generals who were in command.

As a result of that fierce battle, Gudda's muscular body, over two meters long, was marked from head to belly with white tiger claw marks, and he came to be known as the "Tiger Hunter" after the fierce battles he had fought.

Gudda's will to fight remained unshaken even as his army was on the verge of collapse after his "general" was killed.

Then, who would be afraid of him when he was outnumbered and had something to bear behind him?

Gudda: [We're coming for you!]

Gudda's huge body kicked the earth and closed in on the enemy horde, his voice like a volley of gunfire.

Following Gudda's lead, his subordinates, carrying their weapons of choice, rushed toward the starry flag that was coming from the west.

Gudda: [――That one.]

As he approached the moment of impact with his own feet, Gudda looked closely and saw the lead of the enemy―― a red gale horse that was passing in front of the group, causing the ground to rumble.

What caught his attention was not the man pulling the reins of the gale horse. The man was only a reinsman, and what should be seen was a small being riding the gale horse as if held by the man.

A black-haired boy who was holding a girl in his arms and looking straight at them with dark eyes.

The boy was neither running ahead nor deviating from his position, but was charging forward as if it were natural for him to be in that position.

A boy with black hair and black eyes, the "black-haired crown prince" who had been talked about before the war started.

???: [――Hk!]

Gudda bit down on the thought with his back teeth and focused on what he had to do.

Taking advantage of a ridiculous rumor, the rebels had prepared a large number of "black-haired princes" and foolishly challenged this Imperial Capital to a decisive battle. Therefore, the "generals" who had been tasked with defending the Capital―― or rather, the generals and soldiers, had all made up their minds.

The authenticity of the black-haired child is of no concern. ――There is but one Emperor we ought to look up to.

Gudda: [――You damned traitors who backstabbed our Emperor Vincent Vollachia!!]

Gudda, wielding two heavy metal clubs, shouted like a tiger, the symbol of the name he hunted, and approached the boy running at the front of the pack.

In front of them was a boy riding a red gale being followed by the rebels.

Gudda, the "general" himself, struck a blow into the enemy's nose, hoping to reap all of them. The blow made a tremendous impact and blasted the eardrums of the weak.

Gudda's thick arm also felt a satisfying response, and his eyes widened.

The black-haired boy was supposed to be crushed together with the gale horse, but the metal club caught neither him nor the gale horse he was riding――,

???: [I have to protect Schwartz, since it is now my main duty to do so.]

With a body larger than his own and four thick, strong arms, he held a large shield in his hand, which he used to directly block a blow―― or rather, two blows from Gudda's metal club.

Gudda's throat choked up at the astonishing sight, given the physical capabilities of the multi-armed tribe.

Slipping into that momentary stagnation――,

???: [And it's up to me to beat… Schwartz's enemies…!]

Gudda: [——Hk!]

His voice, hushed yet courageous, and filled with a strong sense of pride and honor, struck Gudda in the torso, launching his huge body into the sky.

The man who struck Gudda with the blow was a man with tattoos all over his body, and he was holding a large hammer wielded with both hands.

He was well trained. But with his physique and amateurish movements, how could he have ――No, it was not only because of what had happened to him that he asked why.

Rebels: [RAHHHHHHHH——!!!]

Gudda, who had taken the lead, was blown away, and the clashes between the rebels and Imperial soldiers continued.

Even if Gudda's head were to be chopped off, he had trained his men well enough not to lose their will to fight. It was precisely because of this pride that the scene below was hard to believe.

All at once, before they could even mount a decent resistance, the Imperial soldiers were crushed and utterly pulverized by the onslaught of the onrushing rebel hordes.

The sight was so shocking that Gudda's entire body was filled with a rage greater than the time when he had seen the head of a "general" crushed to bits right before his eyes――,

Gudda: [――This is ridiculous.]

And so, as a "general" who had fought in many battles, he let out a ragged breath at the sight he could not understand.

△▼△▼△▼△

――There are exceptions to everything.

The exceptions were Gudda Dialmo, a fierce general, and the Pleiades Battalion, a threatening group of amateurs that crushed the strong warriors he had trained.

They had no training, and they had no fine armaments, and they had no firm cause.

All they had was a really, really strong will to unite, and a vow to themselves that they would not back down no matter what.

And that was precisely the kind of thing that made the Pleiades Battalion an extraordinary group of people.

Recall the lengthy lecture on the shortcomings of yang magic.

Its use, which depended on the skill of the caster and the number of people, and often disrupted people’s coordination of their various operations, earned the former Emperor the stigma of a "Great Failure of an Emperor", and even Vincent Vollachia, who was proclaimed as a wise emperor, quickly abandoned the idea of using it at the consideration stage.

But what if, hypothetically, something like it was possible?

All of the hundreds, or even thousands, of troops would be given a uniform enhancement of the same effectiveness, and yet all of them would not suffer from the gap between their original fighting ability and the skill level of their strengthened selves.

And, the key would be that there would not be the need to have the same number of yang magic users as troops. ――If such dreamlike or miraculous conditions were met, would it not be feasible?

It was a pipe dream that Vincent Vollachia would laugh at and discard if he heard it.

An incidental coincidence that would even be said to be possible only in this time of war, in this situation, in this circumstance.

Only those who accepted Natsuki Subaru―― or rather, "Natsuki Schwartz", as the center of themselves, who sincerely believed in him as their friend, and who sincerely believed in him as their companion, would be able to achieve a miracle.

――The strengthening effect of the yang attribute would be applied to each of the individuals Subaru shared the effect of Cor Leonis with; that is, all of his friends who worked together with him.

The power of the "Little King", originally intended to share wounds and burdens, would now be exploited to use the power that the king alone could not handle, together with his friends that supported him.

Hence, the Pleiades Battalion――,

Subaru: [――I love you, all of you!]

The thousands of "non-combatants" who traveled with Natsuki Subaru were transformed into an army of warriors and began to lay waste to every battlefield in this battle for the Imperial Capital.
